       "['10 Bird Toys That Are Safe petmd.com /bird/care/10-bird-toys-are-safe When shopping for your bird, you’ll find so many types of bird toys—mirrors, ladders, swings and ropes—that the choices are almost overwhelming. Some of the bird toys might seem flimsy, making you wonder if your bird will break them on the first use. Other toys look like fun, but you remember that she hid from the last thirty-dollar toy you got her. So, how do you decide what to buy? How many bird toys does a bird really need, anyhow? Are all of those ropes and artificial colors safe?',\n",
       " 'Picking Bird Toys Based on Cage Size and Function One of the first things to decide is where your bird’s new toy will go—inside or outside the cage—and in what section of the cage. Make sure your bird’s cage is large enough for the bird toys you want to introduce. Bird toys that are going to stay outside the cage can obviously be larger and more elaborate than those inside the cage. For larger birds, there are many bird playstands, bird perches and toys\\xa0for the top of bird cages. As a rule, I prefer moving a bird away from the cage and allowing him to play on a freestanding playground as opposed to being on top of their cage. Whenever a bird is in their cage, they should be able to freely fly from end to end. Flying is a natural bird behavior, and they should be allowed to fly anytime they wish to. This means that not only do large birds need really large bird cages, but small birds need pretty big bird cages, too. Most birds are kept in cages that are much too small and do not allow them to actually fly. First evaluate whether you have an appropriately sized cage. Even with a cage that has plenty of room to fly, you must also make sure that any toy that is placed inside the cage should be situated so as not to interfere with this activity. Designate a “flying area” of the cage (usually the top half) and keep it free of all hanging bird toys. Then reserve a corner or area in the bottom half of the cage for bird toys.',\n",
       " 'Which Type of Bird Toys Should You Get? The type of bird toys you pick will depend on your bird’s species, personality, likes and dislikes. Watching your pet and some trial and error will help you to sort this out. As a rule, bigger birds like toys to grapple and chew on. Smaller birds like bells, mirrors and swings. All sizes seem to like soft fleece toys that have come on the market in recent years, like the Super Bird Creations peekaboo perch bird. That 10/28/24, 10:12 PM 10 Bird Toys That Are Safe https://www.printfriendly.com/p/g/PdAh6M 1/3 being said, my African grey parrot adores his swing, and my Lutino Lovebird has a big rope chew toy that he gnaws on for hours. See what your bird likes, and purchase similar bird toys. Don’t be afraid to throw something different into the mix on occasion. Bird toys are made for mental stimulation and environmental enrichment. Even if your bird decides not to use a new toy, he undoubtedly thought about it for a while, which equates to mission accomplished!',\n",
       " 'How Many Bird Toys Should a Bird Have? Don’t clutter the cage with bird toys. Most birds really only need two to three bird toys at a time to keep them busy. However, playing with the same toys over an extended period of time can become very boring for them. My general routine is to tear all of my cages apart for a complete top-to-bottom cleaning once per week. When I do this, I remove all of the toys and replace them with new ones. I keep a stash of eight to 12 bird toys in a box and rotate them on a weekly basis. Now, if there was a favorite toy—like the swing for my African grey—I might not take it away, but rather move it to a different part of the cage. Or I might replace it with a similar swing that is just different enough to make him explore it as if it was new. You might want to remove and replace one toy a day. Do whatever works for your routine and your pet—just switch the toys often enough to keep life interesting for your bird. With some bird toys, something as simple as turning a toy upside down makes it “new”!\\xa0 Use your imagination!',\n",
       " 'What Should You Look for in a Bird Toy? Above all else, you want your new bird toy to be completely safe for your bird. Look the toy over carefully—are there any strings or strands of rope which could be pulled or chewed free and wrap around a leg or toe? I have amputated many bird legs and feet thanks to dangerous toys constricting the blood flow to a leg. Could your bird break off a piece and swallow it? Some of the rawhide chews on the market are soft enough that bigger birds in particular can rip chunks off, which then get stuck in their intestines. Are there any flimsy pieces of wood that they may swallow? Check how the bird toy hangs very carefully—sometimes toenails, toes or feet can become trapped in the catches or chains, causing severe injury. 10/28/24, 10:12 PM 10 Bird Toys That Are Safe https://www.printfriendly.com/p/g/PdAh6M 2/3 Also look to see how easily the toy can be cleaned. Many birds like to sit over their toys and poop on them … or regurgitate food to “feed” their favorite toy … or yes, sometimes even try to mate with them.\\xa0 All of these favorite bird activities can leave the toys pretty soiled. So it is smart to make sure that you can clean the toy easily. If it is one that you will have to dispose of once it is dirty, that gets expensive quickly.',\n",
       " 'Things to Consider When Choosing the Best Bird Toys In short, try to think like a bird when picking out bird toys. If someone hung this thing in the middle of your living room, would it be in your way if you were flying to the kitchen for a snack? Does it look like something you’d have fun climbing around on or looking at? Is there anything about it that might snag any part of your body if you were playing with it? Is it tasty and okay to eat? If not, will I get sick if I do decide to eat it? Bird toys don’t have to be expensive. You can try out new bird toys and also make a few of your own.\\xa0Cutting some bird-safe fruit branches (pesticide-free!) to use as bird perches\\xa0and chewing toys counts perfectly well as mental stimulation and enrichment. Some birds even love paper towel rolls stuffed with newspaper. Watch what your bird likes to do and watch what wild birds do with their time, then let your imagination take over! There is nothing more fun than trying to think like your companion bird and understanding what (and why) they do what they do.',\n",
       " 'Bird Toy Options by Size Here are some ideas of potential bird toys to get you started.

       "['Briard Dog Breed Health and Care petmd.com /dog/breeds/briard The Briard is an ancient French herding dog with a rugged appearance and star- studded history. Also called Chien Berger de Brie (named after the region of France responsible for producing Brie cheese), the Briard dog breed dates back to at least the 8th century, as they can be seen depicted in tapestries alongside Emperor Charlemagne. Roughly 1,000 years later, another emperor—Napoleon Bonaparte—reportedly kept Briards, and Thomas Jefferson received a Briard as a gift for serving as an U.S. ambassador to France. Briard dogs were bred to both guard and herd sheep, and they’re exceptionally equipped for the role. Recognized by the American Kennel Club in 1928, the official breed standard describes the Briard’s movements as being like “quicksilver, permitting him to make [the] abrupt turns, springing starts, and sudden stops required of the sheepherding dog.” This description is even more impressive when you consider the breed’s large size (22–27 inches at the shoulder and 55–100 pounds). The standard also notes that the French Briard is “a dog of heart, with spirit and initiative, wise and fearless with no trace of timidity.”',\n",
       " 'Caring for a Briard Despite being bred for outdoor work and life, the Briard Club of America (BCA) notes that Briards are house pets that are happiest by their human’s side. But that doesn’t mean you should disregard their working ways; understanding their instincts is key to providing Briards with the best care. Case in point: Briards need a job (i.e., something physical to which they can devote their energy and strength). Luckily, their interests aren’t limited to sheepherding, and they make excellent hiking, biking, and running companions. And while French Briards are intelligent and eager to please, they have a unique confidence and independence that comes from being bred to make decisions in their human’s absence. The Briard’s sheepherding background is also responsible for their strong desire to herd young children in their family, as well as their wariness of new pets and people. That being said, Mary Jeanne Millner, BCA member and owner of Sendero Briards, believes the perfect Briard home is a house full of busy children who interact well with their furry companion. Growing up in the midst of a young family’s chaotic comings and goings is an ideal setup for socializing a Briard pup, she says. 10/26/24, 11:38 AM Briard Dog Breed Health and Care https://www.printfriendly.com/p/g/eXKYH6 1/7 Briards can do well with other dogs, but Millner recommends they be of the opposite sex to decrease the likelihood of conflict. “And if you want cats,” she says, “it’s best to adopt the cat first so they can teach the young Briard who’s boss.”',\n",
       " 'Briard Health Issues Briard dogs are a relatively healthy breed with a lifespan of approximately 12 years. However, like all breeds, they are prone to certain health conditions.',\n",
       " 'Hip Dysplasia Hip dysplasia is a condition in which the hip joint doesn’t develop properly. It’s characterized by a looseness that leads to osteoarthritis in dogs. Mild cases are treated with interventions like physical therapy and anti-inflammatory drugs, but severe cases may require surgery. Common signs of hip dysplasia include: Limping Reluctance to get up or jump Shifting of weight to front legs Loss of muscle mass in back legs Hip pain',\n",
       " 'Eye Conditions The Briard dog breed is predisposed to several eye conditions: Dogs with congenital stationary night blindness have had difficulty seeing in low or dim light from birth. The condition doesn’t get better or worse with time, though dogs with the condition can live happy, healthy lives with a little extra help from their pet parents. Hereditary cataracts cause the eye’s lens to become cloudy. This stops light from reaching the retina, resulting in vision loss. If you notice cloudiness or signs of vision loss (such as clumsiness) in your dog, notify your veterinarian. Cataracts are progressive, and surgery is the only treatment. Corneal dystrophy is characterized by a white, opaque area that develops in the center of the cornea (the surface of the eye). If the lesion grows, it can affect vision. Corneal dystrophy doesn’t usually cause pain or require treatment unless it becomes advanced, resulting in an ulceration. In these cases, pet parents are advised to contact a veterinary eye specialist. 10/26/24, 11:38 AM Briard Dog Breed Health and Care https://www.printfriendly.com/p/g/eXKYH6 2/7',\n",
       " 'Hypothyroidism Hypothyroidism is when a dog’s thyroid gland isn’t producing enough thyroid hormones, which serve an important function in metabolism. This hormone deficiency affects the functioning of most organ systems of the body, and treatment requires lifelong hormone replacement therapy with oral medication. Hypothyroidism tends to affect medium- to large-sized dogs like the Briard, and it’s most common in dogs 4–10 years old.\\xa0Most signs of hypothyroidism are related to a dog’s decreased metabolism and include: Unexplained weight gain Lethargy Inability to stay warm Mental dullness Skin infections and ear infections',\n",
       " 'What To Feed a Briard No two Briards are exactly alike, so it’s important to partner with your veterinarian to choose the best food for your dog. Your vet can help you identify a food that meets Association of American Feed Control Officials (AAFCO) standards and is nutritionally complete for your pet’s age, size, and health history.',\n",
       " 'How To Feed a Briard Most adult Briard dogs should eat two meals a day: once in the morning and again in the evening. But because Briard puppies have higher metabolisms than adult dogs, it’s generally best to add a midday feeding for a total of three meals. Your vet can help you determine the best feeding schedule for your dog’s age.',\n",
       " \"How Much Should You Feed a Briard? The nutrition label on your dog’s food bag includes a feeding guide that will give you a general idea of how much to feed your Briard based on their weight. But for a more precise answer, ask your veterinarian. They will tailor their recommendation to your dog’s age, weight, body condition score, lifestyle, and health needs. Be sure to include treats in your daily calorie count for a more accurate view of what your pet is eating. Treats should never make up more than 10% of your dog's daily calorie requirements. 10/26/24, 11:38 AM Briard Dog Breed Health and Care https://www.printfriendly.com/p/g/eXKYH6 3/7\",\n",
       " 'Nutritional Tips for Briards If your Briard is eating a complete and balanced dog food that’s AAFCO-compliant, they shouldn’t need supplementation. However, nutritional supplements are sometimes used to treat or prevent certain health conditions. Talk to your veterinary team before adding anything new to your dog’s diet—including supplements.',\n",
       " 'Behavior and Training Tips for Briards Briard Personality and Temperament Millner describes life with Briards as similar to living alongside a teenager. “They still need guidance, but they don’t want it,” she says. “And they do love you—most of the time.” In other words, Briards are a fascinating mix of intelligence, independence, loyalty, and love. Their independent thinking came in handy while on the job as sheepherders and guardians, but in a family setting, you’ll need to provide consistent direction. The Briard’s sheepherding background is responsible for their strong desire to herd young children in their family, as well as their wariness of new pets and people. The Briard’s working-dog instincts affect other aspects of their personality as well. They can be unsure when meeting new people and animals, and they may also attempt to herd children. And while they can live with other pets (including cats), introductions need to be done slowly and correctly, no matter if your Briard is meeting a cat or another dog. Your Briard may not be working dog, but he will still need a “job” in the form of daily mental and physical exercise, and close companionship. However, Millner notes that Briards also love hanging out on the sofa with their people.',\n",
       " 'Briard Behavior As a result of their history, Briards can be on high alert and can be aloof around strangers. But early socialization, consistent mental stimulation, and lifelong training can help ease their working instincts. Briards need daily exercise and time with their people. Bored, lonely Briards with energy to burn are more likely to engage in unwanted behaviors like excessive barking and chewing. 10/26/24, 11:38 AM Briard Dog Breed Health and Care https://www.printfriendly.com/p/g/eXKYH6 4/7',\n",
       " 'Briard Training It’s important to safely expose your Briard puppy to various animals, people, environments, activities, and objects during their first 16 weeks of life. This is a crucial learning period for every puppy, and socializing your pup can help them feel comfortable in a wide variety of settings they’ll encounter throughout their life. Talk to your Briard dog breeder about how they approach socialization, and ask your veterinarian to suggest activities that are safe for your pet’s age. Briards are famously intelligent and trainable, with a strong desire to please those they love. However, they can be willful thanks to their history as independent workers. Consistent, positive training that uses rewards instead of punishment is the best approach. The training process is also a great way to provide Briards with mental and physical exercise while building the human-animal bond. If you use treats as a reward during training, be sure to factor them into your dog’s daily calorie count. Play, dog toys, and other things your pup enjoys can also be used as rewards.',\n",

       "['briard dog breed health and care petmd.com /dog/breeds/briard the briard is an ancient french herding dog with a rugged appearance and star- studded history. also called chien berger de brie (named after the region of france responsible for producing brie cheese), the briard dog breed dates back to at least the 8th century, as they can be seen depicted in tapestries alongside emperor charlemagne. roughly 1,000 years later, another emperor—napoleon bonaparte—reportedly kept briards, and thomas jefferson received a briard as a gift for serving as an u.s. ambassador to france. briard dogs were bred to both guard and herd sheep, and they’re exceptionally equipped for the role. recognized by the american kennel club in 1928, the official breed standard describes the briard’s movements as being like “quicksilver, permitting him to make [the] abrupt turns, springing starts, and sudden stops required of the sheepherding dog.” this description is even more impressive when you consider the breed’s large size (22–27 inches at the shoulder and 55–100 pounds). the standard also notes that the french briard is “a dog of heart, with spirit and initiative, wise and fearless with no trace of timidity.”',\n",
       " 'caring for a briard despite being bred for outdoor work and life, the briard club of america (bca) notes that briards are house pets that are happiest by their human’s side. but that doesn’t mean you should disregard their working ways; understanding their instincts is key to providing briards with the best care. case in point: briards need a job (i.e., something physical to which they can devote their energy and strength). luckily, their interests aren’t limited to sheepherding, and they make excellent hiking, biking, and running companions. and while french briards are intelligent and eager to please, they have a unique confidence and independence that comes from being bred to make decisions in their human’s absence. the briard’s sheepherding background is also responsible for their strong desire to herd young children in their family, as well as their wariness of new pets and people. that being said, mary jeanne millner, bca member and owner of sendero briards, believes the perfect briard home is a house full of busy children who interact well with their furry companion. growing up in the midst of a young family’s chaotic comings and goings is an ideal setup for socializing a briard pup, she says. , briards can do well with other dogs, but millner recommends they be of the opposite sex to decrease the likelihood of conflict. “and if you want cats,” she says, “it’s best to adopt the cat first so they can teach the young briard who’s boss.”',\n",

       " 'hip dysplasia hip dysplasia is a condition in which the hip joint doesn’t develop properly. it’s characterized by a looseness that leads to osteoarthritis in dogs. mild cases are treated with interventions like physical therapy and anti-inflammatory drugs, but severe cases may require surgery. common signs of hip dysplasia include: limping reluctance to get up or jump shifting of weight to front legs loss of muscle mass in back legs hip pain',\n",
       " 'eye conditions the briard dog breed is predisposed to several eye conditions: dogs with congenital stationary night blindness have had difficulty seeing in low or dim light from birth. the condition doesn’t get better or worse with time, though dogs with the condition can live happy, healthy lives with a little extra help from their pet parents. hereditary cataracts cause the eye’s lens to become cloudy. this stops light from reaching the retina, resulting in vision loss. if you notice cloudiness or signs of vision loss (such as clumsiness) in your dog, notify your veterinarian. cataracts are progressive, and surgery is the only treatment. corneal dystrophy is characterized by a white, opaque area that develops in the center of the cornea (the surface of the eye). if the lesion grows, it can affect vision. corneal dystrophy doesn’t usually cause pain or require treatment unless it becomes advanced, resulting in an ulceration. in these cases, pet parents are advised to contact a veterinary eye specialist. , ',\n",
