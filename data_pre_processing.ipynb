       "  'personality and temperament the abtenauer is docile, hardworking, obedient, and undemanding, all of which make it an ideal small draft horse. due to its thick coat, low center of gravity, and powerful legs, it is perfect for hauling loads up in the mountains.',\n",

(the cfa considers both colorpoint shorthair and javanese to be hybrids and hence deserving their own identity, and not just extensions of the siamese and the balinese.) the javanese also has a marked similarity with the balinese. an average cat lover will find it hard to distinguish between the two breeds. both possess similar body shape, personality and coat. the javanese has been named after the island of java because it sounds fanciful and because it possesses so many of the same physical characteristics as the balinese cat (java is the next island over from bali). however, the cat has nothing to do with the island itself and certainly did not originate there. one of the first javanese came into being when a balinese was crossed with a colorpoint shorthair. the result was a siamese-like cat, sporting long hair and possessing a wider range of colors. the cfa would officially recognize the javanese in 1987.',\n",

(these cats would later become the burmese, chocolate point siamese, havana browns, and tonkinese breeds.) during the late 1800s and early 1900s, the siamese and solid- colored cats were exhibited throughout europe. unfortunately, all competitions began banning all siamese cats without blue eyes in the early 20th century. this all changed in the early 1960s, when margaret conroy, a canadian breeder, crossed a sable burmese with a seal point siamese. conroy described the kittens as golden siamese, as they seemed to display characteristics from both breeds. breeders of the cats began achieving a consistent head and body style, and changed the breed name to tonkinese. (a reference to the bay of tonkin near southern china and north vietnam; although there is no correlation to the cat.) in collaboration with other notable breeders like jane barletta of new jersey, conroy wrote the first breed standard -- an abstract aesthetic ideal for the animal type -- which was presented to the canadian cat association (cca). (the tonkinese has the honor of being the first breed to be developed in canada.) in 1971, the cca became the first cat registry to grant championship status to the tonkinese. the cat fanciers' foundation (cfa) recognized the breed in 1974, and the international cat association followed in 1979. in 1984 the cfa granted the tonk championship status. by 1990, it had gained recognition from all major cat fancy associations. dates tell only part of the story. behind the scenes was a great deal of opposition to the tonkinese being recognized as a breed. although the tonkinese exhibited characteristics that had been bred out of the siamese and burmese lines, many saw this new breed as pet quality only, and not suitable for shows. for many in the cat fancy associations, they could not get past what the tonkinese had in its own favor, they only saw what it did not have, by their own standards for what a cat should be. by standards for what a purebred should be. points of view did not change simply because the tonks were given their own class. there is still plenty of opposition for the breed because many do not consider it to be pure, based only on the recent design of the line. it is often forgotten that many breeds have needed to be outcrossed in order to improve the vitality and genetic strength of the line, and that it is the rare breed that is actually pure. at the end of the day, purity of breeding is a relative concept.\",\n",
