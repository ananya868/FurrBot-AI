Data Format guidelines:
This text document provides information on how the data should be formatted for usage. Please go through the following guidelines before 
constructing the dataset!

* Info on Dataset Folder structure is provided in data-folder-structure.md file! 


Guidelines: 
- Text Data: As this will be used in a large language model, the primary data should be text. The optimal context length has to decided.
- Data Cleaning: Data cleaning is essential before any use, as it may contain advertisements or irrelevant information. 
                The data should be cleaned, concise, and limited to blog articles exclusively.
- Length of Text for each instance: The length of each blog or instance may vary, with some containing less content than others.
                We must determine the most effective approach to handle these differences and ensure optimal performance.
- Organized Data: Given the multiple categories and subcategories within the dataset, it's necessary to maintain separate datasets for each category. 
                This approach ensures that appropriate metadata can be used for each specific category.
- Optimize for RAG: The dataset should include metadata to facilitate optimization and re-ranking after retrieval.
                This approach will guarantee that the most relevant and useful information is retrieved, aligning with the userâ€™s query.
- Pipeline: The dataset should be structured to allow the data pipeline to seamlessly ingest new data in the same format as the existing knowledge base. 
                This approach will ensure our chatbot remains updated with the latest information.
