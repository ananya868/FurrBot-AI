"dental disease chinchillas have open-rooted or continuously growing teeth that grow 2-3 inches per year. in the wild, they eat rough, coarse grasses that help keep these continuously growing teeth worn down. many pet chinchillas are fed excessive amounts of dry, crumbly pellets, rather than fibrous hay, and as a result, they don’t chew enough and their teeth don’t wear down properly as they grow. in addition, their top and bottom teeth must meet properly to help wear them down as they grow. a condition called malocclusion occurs when the teeth don’t align properly, so that the teeth surfaces hit each other inside the mouth. once the teeth grow so long that they hit, there is no room for them to grow longer, and they become impacted in the gums and jaw bone (like wisdom teeth in people). both the front (incisor) teeth and back (molar) teeth can become impacted — a very painful condition when the chinchilla tries to chew. overgrown, sharp edges may form along teeth surfaces, leading to cuts on the tongue, cheek, or lips. the roots of overgrown teeth may become infected and abscessed. the chinchilla may have difficulty eating, lose weight, drool, and paw at its mouth. if an owner sees a chinchilla exhibiting any of these signs, the animal should be examined by a veterinarian right away so that treatment may be started. a chinchilla-savvy vet should perform a thorough oral examination and take x-rays of the animal’s head to assess the teeth roots. if the teeth are overgrown and impacted but not infected, the pet should be started on a softer, easier-to-chew diet (such as shredded veggies and chopped hay), or syringe-fed a liquid diet if it cannot chew at all. it should also be given liquid anti-inflammatory medication. if x-rays show infected teeth roots, the infected teeth must be surgically extracted under anesthesia. prognosis for chinchillas with dental disease is better when the animal is treated early on, before they become weak and thin. in general, however, dental problems in chinchillas are recurrent and lifelong. related /24, overgrown teeth and dental issues in chinchillas",Dental Disease,51 Common Diseases That Affect Chinchillas,Chinchillas,352,412
"ringworm chinchillas are common carriers of ringworm — a fungal (not a parasite or worm) skin infection that causes hair loss and crusty, scaly skin, and which is transmissible to people and other pets. skin on the ears, face, and legs is commonly affected; however, chinchillas have very dense fur and can carry microscopic ringworm spores on their thick haircoat without actually showing any signs. owners who notice dry, flaky skin or patches of hair loss on their pets should have them examined by a veterinarian immediately. a veterinarian can diagnose ringworm by culturing the affected skin in special fungal culture media or by having a veterinary laboratory run dna tests on the hair to see whether fungus is present. treatment involves thorough clean-up of all areas in which the chinchilla has been in contact to ensure that no infectious hair is left behind that could re-infect the affected animal, other animals, or people. mildly affected animals can be treated with topical prescription medications applied to the areas of infected skin. more severely affected animals may require long-term treatment with oral prescription medications, as well.",Ringworm,51 Common Diseases That Affect Chinchillas,Chinchillas,185,206
"fur issues chinchillas commonly develop two conditions that involve their fur. first, fur chewing in chinchillas is a common behavioral problem in which they chew on their own or their cage mates’ fur so that the haircoat looks patchy. hair growing back into the chewed regions may be shorter and darker than the original fur. chewing occurs most often over the back and tail but can occur anywhere on the body. theories about why chinchillas do this include stress, hormone imbalances, dietary deficiencies, underlying dental problems, boredom, the presence of other (parasitic or fungal) skin infections, and a genetic predisposition. the most widely accepted explanation is that fur chewing is a displacement behavior in response to environmental stress, such as from an overcrowded cage, the presence of aggressive cage mates or other predatory pets (such as cats and dogs), too frequent handling, or other anxiety-inducing circumstances. a veterinarian can diagnose fur chewing by performing a thorough physical examination and skin tests to eliminate the presence of infections such as ringworm. proper diet must be assured, too, to rule-out dietary deficiencies. the cause of fur chewing may be difficult to pinpoint; treatment may include elimination of possible stressors by providing a larger cage, handling the pet less often, removing other pets or aggressive cage mates, and ensuring a proper diet. offering other, more appropriate things to chew on, such as hay and wooden toys, also may help. /24, the second common fur issue that occurs in chinchillas is fur slip. fur slip is another name for the release of a large patch of fur in response to being grabbed or handled roughly. wild chinchillas have developed this mechanism to escape predators when they are captured. they release big clumps of hair to get out of a predator’s mouth when the predator grabs them. with normal shedding, chinchillas lose small amounts of fur gradually from all over their bodies as hair ages, falls out, and is replaced by new hair growing underneath. this process is gradual, so that obvious bald spots aren’t visible. with fur slip, however, a traumatic event precedes the hair loss, a large amount of hair comes off all at once, and a clean, smooth, bald patch is left behind. short, stubbly hairs may grow back in the bald patch within a few weeks after fur slip occurs, but return to a full, thick, normal coat may take up to several months. owners can prevent fur slip from happening by never grabbing the animal directly by the fur or skin and by always supporting the pet’s body from underneath the chest, abdomen, and hind end. also, owners should never allow other naturally predatory pets, such as cats and dogs, near their chinchillas. these other pets may be good- natured and well-intentioned in carrying the chinchilla in their mouths to play with it, but may actually cause fur slip or worse injuries. related is your chinchilla going bald? it may be a case of fur slip",Fur Issues,51 Common Diseases That Affect Chinchillas,Chinchillas,496,569
"heat stroke wild chinchillas live in the andean mountains where it is cold; they have developed a thick fur coat to keep them warm in a cool climate. but as pets, chinchillas are very susceptible to overheating. they function best at environmental temperatures ranging from 55-70°f and should never be exposed to temperatures above 80°f. they also don’t do well with high humidity. during the summer, or in warm climates, they should be kept indoors in air conditioned, dry areas, and they should never be exposed to direct sunlight without access to shade. a chinchilla suffering from heatstroke appears weak and may be collapsed; it will need to be treated by a veterinarian immediately to cool it off with fluids injected beneath the skin, a sponge bath, and direct air flow from a fan. chinchillas with heatstroke must be treated as soon as possible or they risk stroke, organ failure, brain injury, and even death. related /24, heat stress in chinchillas",Heat Stroke,51 Common Diseases That Affect Chinchillas,Chinchillas,161,185
"gastrointestinal problems gastrointestinal (gi) problems in chinchillas occur secondarily to other systemic illnesses and to other conditions that cause stress or pain. chinchillas with gi disease may have decreased appetite, lethargy, decreased to no stool production, diarrhea, prolapsed (sticking outside the anus) rectal tissue, and a bloated, gas-filled belly. several causes of gi disease in chinchillas exist, including sudden diet change, feeding excessive amounts of carbohydrates (typically chinchilla pellets) or vegetables, a reaction to treatment with antibiotics, gi parasite infection, and overgrowth of abnormal intestinal bacteria or yeast. chinchillas with any of these signs should be seen by a veterinarian as soon as possible. a veterinarian performing a diagnostic work-up for gi disease in a chinchilla might do a stool examination for parasites, abdominal x-rays, bacterial culture of stool, blood testing, and abdominal ultrasound. once the veterinarian determines the cause of the chinchilla’s gi signs, in addition to specific treatment of the underlying cause, he or she can provide general supportive care for gi disease, including subcutaneous fluid administration, syringe feeding, pain relief, treatment with antibiotics and/or anti- yeast medications, and gas-relieving agents, as indicated. emergency surgery may be warranted in cases where a chinchilla is severely bloated or has ingested a foreign object that is obstructing the passage of food through the intestinal tract, but animals with these conditions are usually extremely debilitated and are poor surgical candidates. rectal prolapse, often associated with gi parasites and overgrowth of abnormal gi bacteria or yeast, generally requires surgery. /24, ",Gastrointestinal Problems,51 Common Diseases That Affect Chinchillas,Chinchillas,248,293

"where to buy a chinchilla most owners purchase chinchillas through pet stores or breeders, but regardless of where you buy your chinchilla, make sure you ask questions, said adam denish, vmd, owner of rhawnhurst animal hospital in philadelphia. you’ll want to inquire about previous owners (if any), behavior issues, the animal’s current living situation (as a pair with another chin, in a colony, or solo), and obtain the most complete health history possible. also examine them carefully, said denish. “if they are young, they will most likely be scared and back away initially. over time, they will usually accept your touch,” he said. healthy chinchillas are shy, but when in comfortable surroundings, are quite active. they should have a thick coat of fur with no bare patches. their eyes should be bright with no redness or drainage and there should be no evidence of diarrhea in their habitat. if they are reluctant, he suggests using food as a bridge to entice them. “a young chinchilla is really small and can easily jump out of your hands,” he says. if you adopt an older chin from a breeder or a private seller, you will likely be in the dark when it comes to their previous history. “take time to let them adjust to the new environment,” said denish.",Where to Buy a Chinchilla,Caring for a Chinchilla_ What You Need to Know,Chinchillas,217,256
"what should chinchillas eat? of course, a healthy, adequate diet is important with all animal species. “luckily, chinchillas are able to eat specialized pellets that are a good base diet for them,” said denish. in addition, good quality hay, like alfalfa, timothy, orchard grass and prairie grass, is extremely important to a chinchilla’s digestive tract, he added. a pellet-only /24, diet does not provide enough fiber for chinchillas. in fact, a tablespoon or two of pellets per day is enough for most adults. the rest of their diet should consist of hay, leafy greens, and an occasional treat of dried apples, raisins or sunflower seeds.",What Should Chinchillas Eat?,Caring for a Chinchilla_ What You Need to Know,Chinchillas,105,130
"your chinchilla’s habitat chins need a cage that is safe and secure. denish recommends one with a plastic bottom instead of a wire bottom, as the wire can irritate chinchillas’ feet. as for bedding, he said that there is a variety of bedding that is suitable for chinchillas and can be decided upon based on your preference. good options for bedding include shredded or pelleted paper products, reclaimed wood pulp waste (like carefresh) and aspen or pine shavings (avoid cedar shavings). your chins cage should also be multi-level, denish said. “they need multiple hiding areas so they can escape when they feel threatened.” pvc pipe sections in the shape of a “y,” “t,” or “l” make great chinchilla hiding places and are easy to clean. unfortunately, chinchillas are not easily litter trained, said denish, “but you can always try putting a litter box with appropriate bedding in the corner where they do their business.” a non-leaking water bottle and a food bowl completes the set-up. providing the correct ambient temperature and humidity levels for chinchillas can be challenging. the species is very susceptible to heat stroke, so if you live in a hot and humid part of the country, air conditioning is necessary. temperatures over 80 degrees fahrenheit, particularly combined with high humidity, are extremely dangerous to chinchillas. like many animals, chinchillas have a grooming regimen, and it comes in the form of a dust bath. this is “self-regulated by chinchillas,” said denish, who added that a chinchilla bath house can be purchased at a pet store. expect your chinchilla to “bathe” itself every other day to clean its coat. help your chinchilla keep up its routine by filling a container (or bath house) about two-inches deep with chinchilla dust (available at pet stores), then place your pet chin into it. andrew bean, dvm of pet care veterinary hospital in virginia beach, va, said dust bathing is both a behavioral outlet and an innate behavior which plays an important role in grooming. “chins that don't have a dust bath will develop greasy, matted coats,” he said, adding that chinchillas that are not provided with regular opportunities to bathe may develop irritation of the eyes and respiratory passages.",Your Chinchilla’s Habitat,Caring for a Chinchilla_ What You Need to Know,Chinchillas,367,429
"chinchilla behavior and temperament chinchillas are a species that are best housed as a single pet or as pairs, said denish. he warns against having two members of the opposite sex for breeding reasons. chinchillas are fun as pairs, he said, because it allows them to interact with /24, one another, especially when pet parents don’t have time to give their chin their undivided attention. “even as singles, they are social, and desire contact when in the mood,” he said. denish warned that while chinchillas rarely bite, there is always a risk depending upon the personality and temperament of your chin. by nature, chins are very quick- moving and are not often recommended for children under eight years old, he said. they may be good pets for older children and teens who know how to handle and care for a pet. “the proper way to hold a chin is to scoop it up with one hand underneath its body and use the other hand to support the hind legs and pelvis,” said bean. “if it's a squirmy chinchilla, rather than scooping up from underneath, you can grasp from above with your index finger and middle finger on either side of the neck, and the thumb, ring finger, and pinky curling underneath the body; again, support the hindquarters with the other hand.” bean said that a shocking number of websites advocate grasping the chin at the base of the tail, however, he said it’s very important to avoid doing this. “it is stressful for the chin, and may cause fur slip—[where] the fur in the area [that is] grasped will all suddenly fall out, leaving you holding a wad of fur and the chin running away. it's a natural defense mechanism.” be wary of bringing a chinchilla into multi-pet households, denish said, as unless they are raised together or have been acclimated to one another, dogs and cats may think chinchillas are prey.",Chinchilla Behavior and Temperament,Caring for a Chinchilla_ What You Need to Know,Chinchillas,322,375

"what causes tooth overgrowth in pet chinchillas? pet chinchillas typically are not fed the same type of abrasive foods their wild counterparts consume. instead of eating coarse vegetation, they are generally fed dry pellets that crumble in their mouths, requiring little to no chewing, as well as some hay. hay consumption encourages chewing but not at the same frequency as that performed by wild chinchillas. thus, pet chinchillas’ teeth grow as rapidly as wild chinchillas’, but pets don’t spend as much time chewing, so their teeth may grow in faster than they are worn down. genetic factors as well may predispose to teeth overgrowth. both incisors and back teeth (or “cheek teeth”) can become overgrown. both the portions of the teeth visible in the mouth (the crowns), as well as the parts of the teeth below the gums (the roots) that are not visible inside the mouth, may become elongated. as a result, the crowns visible inside the mouth may look step- like or wavy, while the roots may feel bumpy and irregular when the upper and lower jaws are palpated on the face. the crowns may develop sharp edges and points from irregular wear, causing ulcers and sores on the gums and inside the cheeks. elongated roots below the gum line may become painful and impacted, like impacted wisdom teeth in people, and ultimately may become infected, evolving into large facial abscesses.",What Causes Tooth Overgrowth in Pet Chinchillas?,"Overgrown, Painful Teeth in Chinchillas",Chinchillas,233,266

"what should a chinchilla owner do if he or she notices these signs? owners who observe any of these signs in their pets should have them examined by a veterinarian as soon as possible. delaying the veterinary visit simply leads to worsening of signs and often a poorer prognosis. a chinchilla-savvy veterinarian will not only perform a thorough physical examination, including a comprehensive oral examination using an oral speculum to look at the cheek teeth, but also take x-rays of the head to see the tooth roots not visible from inside the mouth. very stressed or active chinchillas that will not allow a speculum examination may need to be sedated for examination and x-rays. prognosis depends on what the veterinarian finds. chinchillas with early disease involving crown overgrowth or sharp points on the crowns, with normal looking roots on x-rays, may require crown reduction, in which the surfaces of the elongated teeth within the mouth are filed down so that crowns are shorter, even, and smooth. more severely affected animals whose x-rays show elongation and impaction of teeth roots may require long term pain medication to lessen discomfort on chewing. those animals with advanced disease that have developed facial abscesses require surgical removal of infected teeth and debridement of the abscess, as well as treatment with antibiotics, pain killers, and anti-inflammatories. very severely affected chinchillas may need to be fed soft foods or even be supplemented with syringe feeding a gruel-like formula to maintain their weight. dental problems in chinchillas are lifelong and typically require repeated treatment. owners of chinchillas with dental problems should be prepared for recurrent trips to the veterinarian and the long-term expense that goes with these visits.",What Should a Chinchilla Owner Do if He or She Notices These Signs?,"Overgrown, Painful Teeth in Chinchillas",Chinchillas,281,311

"your chinchilla’s diet chinchillas are south american rodents that have continuously growing, open-rooted teeth to compensate for the wear that occurs from chewing on very abrasive, high- fiber grass and hay. to try to mimic this rough vegetation, the mainstay of pet chinchillas’ diets should be hay offered in unlimited quantities. commercial pelleted food is also available for chinchillas but should be offered in limited quantities of no more than one-to-two tablespoons per day for an adult chinchilla. growing, breeding, and nursing chinchillas may be fed a larger amount of pellets to provide additional calories, protein, fat and calcium. fresh greens, such as dark green lettuces, should also be given to provide additional water and fiber. fresh drinking water should be offered daily in a water bowl or bottle. chinchillas in the wild tend to consume most of their food early in the morning and late at night. similarly, pet chinchillas should be offered food twice a day but may consume food throughout the day, as they tend to eat more slowly than other small animals such as rabbits and guinea pigs.",Your Chinchilla’s Diet,What Do Chinchillas Eat_,Chinchillas,182,207

"ringworm – not a worm, it just looks like one ringworm is actually not a worm or parasite, it is a fungus. it is transmittable to people and to other pets through infectious fungal spores that sit on affected hair shafts. these fungal spores can persist in dry environments for up to several years. infected chinchillas have small patches of dry, scaly skin, commonly on the nose, ears, and legs. however, severely affected animals can have these patches anywhere on their bodies, and the affected skin may appear red, inflamed, and scabbed. a veterinarian can diagnose ringworm by culturing the affected skin in special fungus culture media, or by having a veterinary laboratory run dna tests on the hair to see whether fungus is present. treatment for ringworm involves a thorough clean-up of all areas in which the chinchilla has been in contact to ensure that no infectious hair is left behind that could re-infect the animal patient, other animals, or people. mildly affected animals can be treated with topical prescription medications applied to the areas of infected skin. more severely affected animals may require long term treatment with oral prescription medications, as well.","Ringworm – Not a Worm, It Just Looks Like One",Why Does Chinchilla Lose Hair_ _ Bald Spots on Chinchilla,Chinchillas,194,219
