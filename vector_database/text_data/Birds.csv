"10 bird toys that are safe petmd.com /bird/care/10-bird-toys-are-safe when shopping for your bird, you’ll find so many types of bird toys—mirrors, ladders, swings and ropes—that the choices are almost overwhelming. some of the bird toys might seem flimsy, making you wonder if your bird will break them on the first use. other toys look like fun, but you remember that she hid from the last thirty-dollar toy you got her. so, how do you decide what to buy? how many bird toys does a bird really need, anyhow? are all of those ropes and artificial colors safe?",10 Bird Toys That Are Safe,10 Bird Toys That Are Safe,Birds,97,121
"picking bird toys based on cage size and function one of the first things to decide is where your bird’s new toy will go—inside or outside the cage—and in what section of the cage. make sure your bird’s cage is large enough for the bird toys you want to introduce. bird toys that are going to stay outside the cage can obviously be larger and more elaborate than those inside the cage. for larger birds, there are many bird playstands, bird perches and toys for the top of bird cages. as a rule, i prefer moving a bird away from the cage and allowing him to play on a freestanding playground as opposed to being on top of their cage. whenever a bird is in their cage, they should be able to freely fly from end to end. flying is a natural bird behavior, and they should be allowed to fly anytime they wish to. this means that not only do large birds need really large bird cages, but small birds need pretty big bird cages, too. most birds are kept in cages that are much too small and do not allow them to actually fly. first evaluate whether you have an appropriately sized cage. even with a cage that has plenty of room to fly, you must also make sure that any toy that is placed inside the cage should be situated so as not to interfere with this activity. designate a “flying area” of the cage (usually the top half) and keep it free of all hanging bird toys. then reserve a corner or area in the bottom half of the cage for bird toys.",Picking Bird Toys Based on Cage Size and Function,10 Bird Toys That Are Safe,Birds,277,304
"which type of bird toys should you get? the type of bird toys you pick will depend on your bird’s species, personality, likes and dislikes. watching your pet and some trial and error will help you to sort this out. as a rule, bigger birds like toys to grapple and chew on. smaller birds like bells, mirrors and swings. all sizes seem to like soft fleece toys that have come on the market in recent years, like the super bird creations peekaboo perch bird. that , being said, my african grey parrot adores his swing, and my lutino lovebird has a big rope chew toy that he gnaws on for hours. see what your bird likes, and purchase similar bird toys. don’t be afraid to throw something different into the mix on occasion. bird toys are made for mental stimulation and environmental enrichment. even if your bird decides not to use a new toy, he undoubtedly thought about it for a while, which equates to mission accomplished!",Which Type of Bird Toys Should You Get?,10 Bird Toys That Are Safe,Birds,167,190
"how many bird toys should a bird have? don’t clutter the cage with bird toys. most birds really only need two to three bird toys at a time to keep them busy. however, playing with the same toys over an extended period of time can become very boring for them. my general routine is to tear all of my cages apart for a complete top-to-bottom cleaning once per week. when i do this, i remove all of the toys and replace them with new ones. i keep a stash of eight to 12 bird toys in a box and rotate them on a weekly basis. now, if there was a favorite toy—like the swing for my african grey—i might not take it away, but rather move it to a different part of the cage. or i might replace it with a similar swing that is just different enough to make him explore it as if it was new. you might want to remove and replace one toy a day. do whatever works for your routine and your pet—just switch the toys often enough to keep life interesting for your bird. with some bird toys, something as simple as turning a toy upside down makes it “new”! use your imagination!",How Many Bird Toys Should a Bird Have?,10 Bird Toys That Are Safe,Birds,209,234
"what should you look for in a bird toy? above all else, you want your new bird toy to be completely safe for your bird. look the toy over carefully—are there any strings or strands of rope which could be pulled or chewed free and wrap around a leg or toe? i have amputated many bird legs and feet thanks to dangerous toys constricting the blood flow to a leg. could your bird break off a piece and swallow it? some of the rawhide chews on the market are soft enough that bigger birds in particular can rip chunks off, which then get stuck in their intestines. are there any flimsy pieces of wood that they may swallow? check how the bird toy hangs very carefully—sometimes toenails, toes or feet can become trapped in the catches or chains, causing severe injury. , also look to see how easily the toy can be cleaned. many birds like to sit over their toys and poop on them … or regurgitate food to “feed” their favorite toy … or yes, sometimes even try to mate with them. all of these favorite bird activities can leave the toys pretty soiled. so it is smart to make sure that you can clean the toy easily. if it is one that you will have to dispose of once it is dirty, that gets expensive quickly.",What Should You Look for in a Bird Toy?,10 Bird Toys That Are Safe,Birds,229,251
"things to consider when choosing the best bird toys in short, try to think like a bird when picking out bird toys. if someone hung this thing in the middle of your living room, would it be in your way if you were flying to the kitchen for a snack? does it look like something you’d have fun climbing around on or looking at? is there anything about it that might snag any part of your body if you were playing with it? is it tasty and okay to eat? if not, will i get sick if i do decide to eat it? bird toys don’t have to be expensive. you can try out new bird toys and also make a few of your own. cutting some bird-safe fruit branches (pesticide-free!) to use as bird perches and chewing toys counts perfectly well as mental stimulation and enrichment. some birds even love paper towel rolls stuffed with newspaper. watch what your bird likes to do and watch what wild birds do with their time, then let your imagination take over! there is nothing more fun than trying to think like your companion bird and understanding what (and why) they do what they do.",Things to Consider When Choosing the Best Bird Toys,10 Bird Toys That Are Safe,Birds,202,225

"windows, doors, fans, etc. like their wild counterparts, pet birds can be adept flyers but often face hazards in homes that wild birds would never encounter. flighted pet birds often fly out open windows and doors and smack into mirrors and ceiling fans. they also fly into open washers, dryers and refrigerators. if they land on top of an open door, and if that door is slammed, they may get crushed. pet birds can fly into open containers of hot food and liquid (such as coffee, tea, soup and boiling water) and into open flames (in fireplaces and lit candles). they can fly into open toilets, where they may drown, or down to the floor, where they may accidentally get stepped on. birds also fly into venetian blinds where they get stuck between slats or caught up in cords. if you are going to allow your bird to fly, he or she must be supervised when out of the cage. otherwise, you can limit your bird’s ability to fly with a temporary wing clipping, performed by your veterinarian, that should allow your bird to sail safely to the floor but not get lift and that will grow back in a few months if you decide that flight is right.","Windows, Doors, Fans, Etc.",10 Home Dangers for Pet Birds,Birds,209,238
"aerosols birds have unique respiratory tracts that are exquisitely sensitive to aerosolized toxins. non-stick coatings such as teflon found on pots and pans and inside some stoves and toaster ovens may kill pet birds when these coatings are heated to high temperatures. when hot, these coatings release a colorless, odorless vapor that, when breathed in by birds, causes fluid to accumulate in their lungs, leading to almost immediate death. , in addition, certain candles have lead in the wicks that may become aerosolized when the candles burn and should never be lit anywhere near birds. other airborne toxins, such as incense, cooking fumes, spray cleaners and perfumes, may be irritating to the lining of birds’ respiratory tracts and should never be used around them. image: i wall / shutterstock",Aerosols,10 Home Dangers for Pet Birds,Birds,129,147
"secondhand smoke as with aerosols, birds are acutely sensitive to cigarette and cigar smoke. smoke inhalation by birds can lead to recurrent respiratory tract infections, difficulty breathing and even death. birds can get sick not only from breathing in smoke but also from ingesting nicotine off smokers’ hands or clothing. birds perching on a nicotine-coated hand can end up with irritated feet, beaks and mouths. birds whose feet are irritated by nicotine may chew on their toes until they bleed. birds also may ingest nicotine when they preen feathers on which secondhand smoke has landed. even smokers who smoke nowhere near their birds have nicotine and other chemicals deposited on their clothes that their birds can pick up when these pets perch on them. thus, if you smoke, even if it’s away from your pets, a bird is not the best pet for you.",Secondhand Smoke,10 Home Dangers for Pet Birds,Birds,144,161
"well-intentioned playmates many bird owners also have cats and dogs and, as natural predators, these pets often instinctually to want to run after prey such as birds. even if they are well-meaning, playful dogs and cats have sharp nails that can puncture a bird’s thin skin, as well as strong jaws and teeth that can crush a bird’s small body. scratches and bite wounds inflicted by dogs and cats can introduce foreign bacteria into birds’ systems, often leading to serious, sometimes deadly infection. like playful dogs and cats, well-intentioned young children who simply want to play with a bird may restrain it too tightly or drop it, leading to significant injury or even death. therefore, dogs, cats and young children should never be allowed to interact with birds without supervision, no matter how gentle these seemingly friendly playmates seem. , ",Well-Intentioned Playmates,10 Home Dangers for Pet Birds,Birds,140,162
"certain foods foods containing chocolate, caffeine and alcohol are toxic to birds and should never be offered to them, even in small amounts. in addition, avocadoes, garlic, onions and salty foods, such as pretzels, chips, popcorn and some crackers, can also cause serious illness in birds. avocadoes can cause birds’ lungs to fill with fluid, while garlic and onions can cause birds to develop potentially fatal anemia. ingestion of large quantities of salt can upset a bird’s electrolyte and fluid balance, potentially resulting in cardiac problems. like us, birds love to eat, but bird owners must be wise to not feed their pets potentially toxic treats.",Certain Foods,10 Home Dangers for Pet Birds,Birds,106,126
"poisonous plants birds like to chew on everything around them, including plants. in the wild, birds naturally gnaw on plants to survive. many pet owners have plants in their homes and never think about whether they are safe for birds to ingest. some bird owners may let their birds perch on plants in their yards or on their porches without ever considering what they are perching on. certain plants simply irritate a bird’s gastrointestinal tract when ingested, while others may cause death. common houseplants unsafe for birds include calla lilies, mistletoe, philodendron, rhododendron, poinsettia and yew. before allowing a pet bird exposure to a plant, bird owners should check with their veterinarians or a pet poison control hotline to be sure that the plant is safe.",Poisonous Plants,10 Home Dangers for Pet Birds,Birds,126,142
"drugs ingestion of prescription and over-the-counter drugs for humans is a common cause of death among all types of pets each year, according to the aspca. birds, in particular, are attracted to smooth, colorful objects like pills and love to put them in their mouths, often accidentally ingesting them. once ingested, pills are rapidly metabolized by birds, and their accidental ingestion of human medications at high doses intended for people can lead to serious illness and death. bird owners must be vigilant to never leave out medications for their birds to access. , ",Drugs,10 Home Dangers for Pet Birds,Birds,93,106
"pest traps common items used to catch insects and rodents, such as sticky paper, glue traps and snap traps, can cause serious injury and death if a bird gets into them. flighted birds can land on traps and get stuck in them, plus birds can ingest poison bait from traps and die. attempts to unstick birds from glue traps, even with gentle solvents commonly used for this purpose, such as dawn dishwashing detergent, can lead to tearing of their delicate skin and painful ripping out of their feathers. glue or baited pest traps should never be used around birds, and birds trapped in these devices should receive immediate veterinary care.",Pest Traps,10 Home Dangers for Pet Birds,Birds,110,122
"human microbes while birds feed each other by ingesting food and regurgitating it back up to share, this is not something pet owners should do for their birds, as humans have bacteria, yeast, and other organisms in their mouths that are not found in birds and that can cause serious, potentially fatal infections. therefore, bird owners should never share food from their mouths with their birds or even from their plates, if food on the plate has been touched with utensils that have been inside a human mouth. just as new parents need to baby-proof their homes, and new dog owners need to puppy-proof theirs, bird owners should bird-proof their homes, too, particularly if their birds fly. as the saying goes, an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure, and when it comes to keeping your pet bird safe and happy in your home, this is certainly true. , ",Human Microbes,10 Home Dangers for Pet Birds,Birds,151,172

"lovebirds lovebirds are one of the smaller members of the parrot family, which are often common “starter” birds for new bird parents. many people associate lovebirds as coming in pairs, since they are often seen in photographs snuggled up to a companion. it is certainly appropriate to get a pair of birds—but in this case, the birds may choose to socialize with each other, rather than the human family. for this reason, many people choose to own a single lovebird. however, if this is the case, a lone lovebird will need a lot of consistent attention and socialization. , lovebirds, like all parrots, tend to be a little strong willed about their desires, and make their wants and needs clearly known. this can sometimes be accompanied by a firm nip, meaning that significant time needs to be invested in social interaction and training with any members of the parrot family, lovebirds included. lovebirds are comical, colorful, entertaining birds that are highly intelligent and learn tricks and games quickly. many birds develop a wide repertoire of sounds and words and enjoy learning new vocal skills. some lovebirds can be rowdy, meaning that they may not be an ideal choice in apartment-type households or in homes where people need to sleep during the day. they thrive with plenty of social out-of-cage interactions–typically daily.",Lovebirds,7 Best Pet Bird Species,Birds,221,253

"what pet bird is low maintenance? birds, on average, are not low-maintenance pets. despite the fact that bird stores sell bags of “birdseed” for the vast majority of species, this is not an appropriate diet. purchasing and feeding the appropriate food for your species of bird, buying an appropriate cage and toys, keeping things clean, and spending social time all adds up to significantly more time and expense than that required by an average cat or dog. birds also require specialized veterinary care, meaning that your corner veterinarian is unlikely to be comfortable working with them and that you may need to travel for the birds’ medical needs. many of the pet bird species also have a life expectancy of more than 20 years. this all translates to the fact that the decision to getting a pet bird is a significant investment of time and money. some of the shorter lived and cage content species are likely to be considered the “lowest maintenance,” so owners looking for an avian companion that requires care on the level of a dog or cat might want to consider something along the lines of a budgie, cockatiel, or dove.",What Pet Bird is Low Maintenance?,7 Best Pet Bird Species,Birds,195,217

"second parrot consult your bird’s veterinarian to see if your bird could benefit from having another parrot friend. keep in mind that not all parrots are good candidates for having a roommate. mature parrots that have spent the majority of their life as the only bird in a household may find the introduction of a new bird stressful and upsetting. you will also need to be careful, because housing two sexually mature parrots together can encourage breeding and a whole host of other problems. if you have talked with your veterinarian, and she thinks that the addition of another parrot could be beneficial for your bird, then a new bird could be one way to provide your parrot with some mental and physical exercise. debbie goodrich, president of flight club foundation, says, “despite potential for fighting and injuries, the overall wealth of interaction between each of them is huge, even if they don’t share the same cage.” you will need to follow proper introduction protocols when it comes to bringing home a second bird. that means ensuring the new bird goes through quarantine and that she has been checked by an avian veterinarian and cleared of potential diseases. , 2. use positive parrot training methods bird training can consist of teaching husbandry behaviors, like going in and out of a crate, climbing on a scale to be weighed, climbing back into the cage, and learning to close the door on his own, says cassie malina, certified professional bird trainer and supervisor of staff development at natural encounters in winter haven, florida. “you can also train behaviors that are simply enriching for the parrot and stimulate their problem-solving minds. train them to climb a ladder, pick up a bucket on a string, climb a rope, play basketball, do an obstacle course, stack blocks or cups, match the shapes in puzzles—anything you might imagine.” malina says the key is to train using positive reinforcement and never through punishment. if you offer treats as a reward, be mindful of the type of food offered. “an avian veterinarian should be consulted to help design a diet that is nutritionally balanced, calorically appropriate, leaves some favorite foods available for training only and does not overly stimulate reproductive behavior. free access to treat sticks and seed mixes can disrupt this goal,” explains dr. welle, who is board-certified in avian practice.",Second Parrot 2.

"3. let your bird fly the way your bird spends his energy is as important as how he spends his time, says dr. welle. “i like to discuss alternatives to wing trimming to allow for birds to retain flight. there are safety aspects to this, but as i see an aging population of birds, the long-term effects of sedentary lifestyles is clear.” birds are built for flight, and in the wild, parrots spend a lot of time and energy flying to find food and water. “flight training is a great way to simulate that in our homes and helps us keep our birds happy and healthy,” says sheila blanchette, rehome assistance and possibilities program chairperson with the quaker parrot society. “it also makes every day living with birds a lot easier, since we have a way of asking them to come to us even if we can't reach them, and we are generally able to manage them a lot more safely.” if you do choose to keep your bird flighted, take steps to ensure your home is escape-proof and safe from potential dangers, like boiling pots of water, open flames and toxic substances. you will also need to be vigilant about ensuring that doors and windows are closed, fans are turned off, and that your other pets cannot get ahold of your parrot. it is also important to be mindful of uncovered mirrors. mirrors encourage sexual behaviors and activities, which can be problematic if you have another bird. birds can also be upset by the reflection they see in mirrors. , ",3.

"4. provide a suitable cage and parrot playstand “i think that ultimately we need to move toward larger and more complex enclosures for birds,” says dr. welle. he recommends an aviary or bird room instead of, or in addition to, large bird cages. “it is hard for a bird to spend 20-24 hours in a cage that barely allows for extending the wings and expect that she can engage in normal behaviors.” if you do opt for a cage, experts recommend getting the largest one you can afford. consider creating a play area that’s separate from your bird’s cage. “keep things they like to play with on the stand,” says lisa bono, a certified parrot behavior consultant with the international association of animal behavior consultants who also runs grey parrot consulting. “reward good behavior. make it fun to come out and something they look forward to. that in itself is a reward. turn that stand into a foraging station. by that i mean have various spots on the stand where your parrot can go, explore and perhaps find a favored food. this keeps them busy. a busy beak is a happy beak. a happy beak makes for a happy human. that's what we should strive for.” consider something like the prevue pet products small parrot playstand. smaller parrots might enjoy the penn-plax cockatiels and medium birds wood playpen.",4.

"5. encourage your bird to play parrot games there are a lot of great bird toys for parrots on the market, but not all may be suitable for your bird. consider the species when purchasing or making toys for parrots, says bono. “bigger macaws and cockatoos may like chunkier and harder woods. that, however, is too much work for an african grey parrot. grey parrots like to see destruction.” bono says that many birds enjoy shredding paper or cardboard items along with thinner, softer woods. variety is also important. “they need proper toys to keep their beaks in shape besides just providing enrichment. various parrot perches should be available, as well of different sizes and composite. this aids in proper foot care and exercise,” bono says. parrot bird perches come in a variety of shapes, sizes and materials. examples include the booda large comfy bird perch and polly’s pet products corner bird perch. whichever bird toys or games for parrots you choose should be safe. “inspect rope toys frequently. do not allow more than a half inch of fray, as it can wind around toes, legs or even necks to cause injury or death. make sure you are not buying copper items. some items from a dollar store or craft store can be treated with chemicals,” says bono. , if you are going to offer toys containing metal, stick to toys with stainless steel hardware only, if possible. “[that might mean] buying your own and switching out the nickel-plated hardware most toys come with,” adds bono. the bonka bird toys spoon delight bird toy is made of stainless steel and acrylic and provides birds with shiny objects, noises, and reflective surfaces to keep them entertained.",5.

"tips for new parrot pet parents if you’re ready to make your next pet a winged one, keep these tips from johnson in mind: check shelters first. many parrots of all kinds are given up to shelters for adoption, so be sure to check out your local shelter to see if a parrot needs a home. as with dogs and cats, some shelter birds will need extra training to get them adjusted to a new home, but most ultimately make terrific pets. breeders are another place to look for a new bird. similarly to buying cats or dogs from pet stores, pet store parrots may be the product of bird mills, so check with your local rescue before heading to a pet store. get an expert vet. the only way to know if you have a healthy bird is by visiting an avian vet for complete bloodwork and disease testing. as with all pet care, visiting a specialist can come at a price but will help ensure your new bird is in good shape. ensure proper air quality. birds are very sensitive to their surrounding air and should never be exposed to tobacco smoke, chemical fumes (like hairspray, or cleaners), or teflon-coated materials. exposure to some toxic inhalants may cause immediate death, and chronic exposure can lead to premature death. so always keep your bird in a well ventilated area of your home. expect vocalizing . the squawking, chirping and talking you hear from parrots is an important part of their social communication. parrots in the wild screech at dawn and dusk. bird owners can help train their birds to vocalize at socially acceptable hours, but if you’re going to own a bird, be prepared to accept some noise. prepare for messy eaters. birds eat continually throughout the day, dropping and discarding bits of food everywhere. parrots – called hook-bills – are named as such because they are instinctively programmed to chew and shred wood and other materials, whether it’s a perch, toy, picture frame or furniture (even electrical cords, paper and curtains). so if you’re going to own a parrot, plan its surroundings accordingly. let them fly. birds were designed to fly, and parrots are generally active and inquisitive. an indoor or sheltered outdoor aviary or a flight-safe room (with windows and mirrors covered, no other pets or open doors, and no ceiling fans) that will allow the bird to fly is ideal to enable a bird to get adequate exercise. some people, however, may choose to clip their birds’ wings to gain more control over them for training. birds with clipped wings can get exercise by climbing, swinging and flapping and should be provided with ample space, toys and climbing structures. , provide a complete diet. all birds need a varied diet. while the basis of their diet should be pellets, they also should have a small amount of grains, beans, and fresh fruits and vegetables, too. seed, previously recommended for parrots, is now known to be just fat and to lack most critical nutrients. therefore, it should only be offered to parrots as an occasional treat or as motivation for training purposes. , ",Tips for New Parrot Pet Parents,All About Parrots,Birds,526,601

"things to consider before adopting pet ducks ducks are high-maintenance pets. there’s a lot of cleanup needed, and it’s often a wet and stinky job. for example: ducks need lots of fresh water, and they soil it frequently. so you’ll spend a lot of time refreshing their water. pet ducks usually are unable to fly, so they are a big target for local wildlife predators like coyotes, birds of prey, and even stray cats. this means you have to provide hawk covers, which should be placed over their pens. when outside, your pet ducks will also need to be supervised and protected from potential animal attacks. ducks also don't do well in colder climates. if temperatures drop below 20 degrees fahrenheit, ducks are prone to frostbite on their feet. if you live in an area where it gets colder during winter, it’s important to offer treats that are high in fat and calories. treats such as cracked corn, warm oatmeal, and peanuts may help provide additional warmth overnight as the food digests. you should also provide additional warmth in their environment, such as a layer of straw to place on the coop floor. wooden plants, benches, or stumps are also helpful in keeping ducks off the ground. be sure to insulate your duck house with bales of hay along the inner walls—this will limit how much cold air comes through and allows them to stay warm in their duck house pet ducks can also be noisy, especially when they want something. neighbors may not appreciate the enthusiastic quacks as much as you do.",Things To Consider Before Adopting Pet Ducks,Are Ducks Good Pets What To Know About Pet Ducks,Birds,263,301

"choosing the right enclosure for the first six weeks of life, chicks should be housed in a draft-free, heated pen called a brooder. brooders must be well-ventilated and escape-proof, with walls at least 2 feet high. newly hatched chicks need a minimum of ½ square feet of brooder space each for the first few weeks of life, while chicks older than four weeks should have at least ¾ square feet of brooder space. ideally, pet parents should use a commercially available brooding kit to house their chicks. however, other enclosures, including large plastic storage bins, can be used if the habitat has suitable heat and ventilation. chicks can pack into tight corners and easily suffocate, so it’s best to use a brooder with a rounded or octagonal shape. pet parents can also use cardboard to block off square corners and discourage huddling. after about six weeks, once the chicks have feathered out and grown, they can be transferred to a chicken coop for the rest of their life. for help with selecting the perfect chicken coop, see our care sheet on chickens. setting up your habitat brooders should be kept in a draft-free area that can be kept warm, such as a heated garage, basement, or spare room. ensure the brooder is not accessible to unsupervised children or animals, like curious cats and dogs.",Choosing the Right Enclosure Setting Up Your Habitat,Baby Chicks Care Sheet,Birds,224,256

"chicken care sheet petmd.com /bird/chicken-care-sheet chicken species overview known for their ability to produce farm-fresh eggs, backyard chickens are hardy birds with big personalities! raising a flock of chickens for companionship or egg production can prove to be a rewarding experience for beginner hobbyists. there are hundreds of chicken breeds, each with unique appearances, temperaments, egg-laying abilities, and hardiness against disease. chickens are not legal within every state in the u.s. before deciding to care for a chicken, research the laws and restrictions of your state to determine if the state is zoned to keep chickens and how many you’re allowed to keep at a time. chickens are highly social and should be kept in groups of at least three hens. for most households, a flock of five to six chickens is ideal. healthy hens begin to lay eggs between 18 to 24 weeks of age. depending on the hen’s breed, chicken eggs can appear white, green, blue, brown, or pink in color. hens need at least 12 hours of exposure to uv light each day to absorb dietary calcium and produce healthy eggs. hens produce the highest number of eggs between one and two years old. after that, egg production begins to wane. when overcrowded, chickens will create a “pecking order,” or a hierarchy within the flock. dominant birds that are higher in the pecking order will peck at submissive birds, which can lead to serious injury or even death. if this happens, more space needs to be provided for each chicken. if chickens are still aggressive toward each other even after being moved to a larger coop, they may need to be separated. due to stress, chickens may try to attack each other if kept in an overcrowded habitat. since early 2022, commercial poultry flocks around the world have become infected with highly pathogenic avian influenza (hpai). affected chickens will show signs of decreased energy and appetite, diarrhea, nasal discharge, decreased and/or abnormal egg production, and even sudden death. if you notice any of these signs, contact a veterinarian immediately.",Chicken Care Sheet Chicken Species Overview,Chicken Care Sheet,Birds,342,399

"causes of the causes of egg binding depend somewhat on the species of bird. under normal circumstances, a female bird produces an egg after her ovary releases an ovum into a passage called the oviduct. at this point, the “egg” is just a yolk. as it travels down the oviduct, the egg white material (also known as albumen) begins to accumulate around the yolk and a membrane forms that will then develop into a calcium carbonate shell. the primary causes of egg binding are nutritional deficiencies that lead to improper production of the egg. these can be either from dietary deficiencies or result from over-production of eggs that leads to critical shortages of nutrients including calcium, vitamin e, and selenium. some birds are genetically predisposed to egg binding due either to anatomical or metabolic differences. anatomical issues may be caused by developmental problems or medical obstructions like tumors. other conditions that can increase the risk of egg binding include stress, obesity, lack of exercise, or infection.",Causes of Egg Binding in Birds,Egg Binding in Birds,Birds,166,186

"treatment of in most cases, supportive care for the egg-bound bird will help them pass their egg on their own. this can include providing a heat source, giving fluids for hydration, and correcting any nutritional deficiencies. if greater intervention is needed, your veterinarian may prescribe: calcium injections vitamin d and vitamin a injections , antibiotics pain medications in severe cases, tissue might actually prolapse from your bird, or protrude from the bird’s body. birds with prolapsed tissue are at higher risk of severe complications. in these cases, if the egg can be reached, it will be manually removed and damaged tissue will be treated before gently reducing the prolapse. stitches are often needed to keep the prolapsed tissue where it should be, and the bird will need antibiotics and pain medications as they recover. if the egg binding was caused by weak contractions that were unable to push the egg through the oviduct, the veterinarian may prescribe a medication like oxytocin to stimulate stronger contractions. other medications include prostaglandins and arginine vasotocin which help make the oxytocin more effective in creating stronger contractions to help expel the bound egg. if the bird cannot pass the egg on their own and it cannot be manually delivered in an awake bird, the bird can be placed under general anesthesia. a speculum can be used to manually remove the egg from the oviduct, break the egg down to allow it to be removed, or perform surgery into the abdomen to retrieve the egg.",Treatment of Egg Binding in Birds,Egg Binding in Birds,Birds,250,276
"recovery and management of birds who have experienced an egg binding episode should be rested from reproductive stimuli for at least 2-4 weeks, or preferably for an entire reproductive season. these birds should also be carefully assessed to understand why the egg binding occurred in the first place. dietary deficiencies should be corrected to avoid egg binding in the future. to reduce reproductive signals, try the following: adjusting the amount of daylight the bird is exposed to removing nesting boxes and materials allowing laid eggs to accumulate rearranging cage furnishings to discourage broodiness removing any perceived or actual mates restricting stimulatory petting giving hormonal injections , long-term effects of egg binding can include scarring, strictures, or adhesions within the oviduct. these can all increase the risk of future episodes of egg binding. birds with a history of egg binding may also develop noncancerous lumps or areas of inflammation called granulomas within the oviduct, or they may develop uterine infections. this is especially true for birds with retained yolk or eggshell fragments from previously bound eggs that were removed. prevention of egg binding involves correcting the most likely causes, including providing a healthy diet and making sure your bird isn’t overweight. diet recommendations will vary by species and breed—it’s always recommended to consult with a veterinarian. in severe cases, the oviduct can also be removed surgically if necessary.",Recovery and Management of Egg Binding in Birds,Egg Binding in Birds,Birds,227,250

"should you get a second bird? many bird owners considering getting another bird do so because they are concerned that their pets are lonely or bored. some birds, especially small species such as finches and budgerigars (commonly known as parakeets), do enjoy the company of other birds. however, many birds see their human caretakers as flock- mates and do not necessarily want to interact with other birds, even of the same species, particularly if they have been the only bird in the house for a number of years. certainly, small species should not be mixed with larger species (such as macaws, amazon parrots, cockatoos, eclectus and other big parrots) due to the potential for injury to the small bird. some bird owners rush to bring in a new bird when an existing pet’s cage-mate passes away; however, not all birds will accept new mates, even if they have successfully lived with a mate in the past. if a bird seems bored or depressed, as long as there is no underlying medical reason for the behavior, it is often better to try providing the bird with more mentally stimulating activities (for example, bird toys to chew on, tv to watch, music to listen to, or more time out of the cage) than to introduce another bird. if the resident bird still seems unhappy after being given more to do, trying out the company of a second bird isn’t a bad idea; however, a resident bird’s acceptance of a new bird is a process that can take weeks to months and will not likely be a quick fix for the original bird’s problems. the resident pet may ultimately come to enjoy the company of the new bird, but the introduction must be done correctly and patiently.",Should You Get a Second Bird?,Getting a Second Bird What You Need to Know,Birds,294,334

"how to introduce your new bird to your resident bird once your new bird has been checked out by a veterinarian and deemed healthy, you will want to house it in another room (ideally a separate air space so that any potential undiagnosed or developing disease cannot be spread through airborne transmission) for a minimum of a month (ideally three months, to be sure). this will give your existing bird a chance to hear, but not necessarily see, the new addition and will give you a chance to see how both birds react. after this initial separation period, you can try moving the new bird’s cage into the existing bird’s room, close enough to be visible to the resident bird but not so close as to be able to reach out to the new bird. if the existing bird seems fine with this set up, you can try moving the new pet’s cage closer to the original pet’s and see how they both react. some resident birds are threatened by having new birds moved into their territories; in these cases, a neutral territory, such as a room not yet inhabited by either bird, may be a better place for an introduction. some birds can coexist happily in the same room, a distance apart, but do not like to have other birds in their immediate living spaces. still other birds will not accept new animals at all into their environments and may act jealous or frightened. typically, unless you are introducing a small bird (such as a budgerigar, canary, or finch) to another (or a group) of similar small species, the two birds should not be housed together but rather should be given their own bird cages, feeding stations, perches and toys. birds of similar sizes living in separate cages may sometimes tolerate being out in the same room on separate perches or play stands, but they must be supervised at all times because of potential for injury. it is generally not advised to let big birds out around little birds, as bigger birds have the ability to attack and kill smaller ones if they feel threatened. even birds that have come to live happily in the same room for years can squabble and injure each other if left alone out of their cages. of course, all birds must be supervised at all times, too, if they are out of their cages and other predatory pets, such as cats and dogs, also live in the home. , ",How to Introduce Your New Bird to Your Resident Bird,Getting a Second Bird What You Need to Know,Birds,416,462

"why wild birds eat seeds if we think back to our bird feeders, the seeds the wild birds eat actually make up a pretty small portion of their diets. for every seed they take, they have probably eaten 10 or more bugs, moths, spiders or caterpillars. even in the depth of winter, most wild birds manage to find dormant sources of protein—bugs—available for snacking. the wild bird food seeds they are taking provide calories—mostly in the form of fat— which they can use to supplement their diet, particularly in the winter when it takes them a lot of calories to stay warm. but there are millions upon millions of wild birds that have no access to bird feeders at all—or simply choose not to eat seeds. what do those birds do? some eat wild seeds—which is a good reason not to clear all of the weeds from your yard or deadhead your flowers late in the fall as winter draws near. but birds are perfectly capable of surviving with few, or even no, seeds at all.",Why Wild Birds Eat Seeds,How To Feed A Bird Properly,Birds,176,198
"should you feed seeds to pet birds? so why do we fill our bird cages to the brim with seed bird food for our pet birds? when we boil down the nutrition of a seed, it really is primarily fat and carbohydrates. i tend to think of it as the greasiest, tastiest junk food you can imagine. many animals, given the choice, will gravitate towards unhealthy fats, and most birds are no different. wild birds need that spike of fat and carbohydrates for energy—they have to avoid hawks, spend frigid nights outside, fly miles at a time to find mates and feed growing babies. our pet birds don’t have these huge energy requirements, so they don’t need so much extra fat. , ",Should You Feed Seeds to Pet Birds?,How To Feed A Bird Properly,Birds,122,140
"what should you feed a bird? i recommend pelleted bird foods. these specially formulated kibbles have all of the nutrients required for birds, mixed into a firm pellet (much like dry dog food and cat food). these formulated diets also prevent your bird from picking out the bits she likes and leaving the rest behind. there are quite a few brands on the market, with slight differences depending on the species of bird you have and whether you prefer foods without artificial coloring. some of the major brands include roudybush, zupreem, kaytee and harrison's, amongst others. i have fed many of these over the years with success. in my house, i also supplement pelleted foods with small amounts of healthy people foods such as eggs, chicken, pasta, vegetables and fruits. you should always discuss any supplementary food items with your veterinarian before adding them to your bird’s diet. they can provide you with the proper portion sizes, but a good rule of thumb is that a daily portion size should likely not exceed the size of your bird’s foot. it should also include something from several food groups: protein, vegetable, fruit and carbs.

"tips for transitioning your bird to a new bird food you should always consult your veterinarian to make sure the new bird food is right for your pet. once you have chosen the best food for your pet bird, there are many techniques to transition them from a diet that involves seeds to strictly their new food. one that i recommend for completely healthy birds, particularly younger ones, is the following method: in the morning, i remove all of the seeds (including sprigs of millet) and every other food from the cage, and leave out the new food i want them to eat. the only food available to the bird is the healthy food. no matter the complaints you are treated to, this is all the bird is offered for the day. in the evening, when you go to cover the cage and put the bird to bed, you can add a cup with a few tablespoons of the old diet to the cage. if she has fasted all day, she can snack on this overnight. most birds, however, are tired and no longer interested in eating the old food by evening. in the morning, however, get up early and remove that food from the cage, and replace it with the new pellets. repeat this cycle. generally, within 30 days, the bird is completely transitioned to the pelleted diet, and you can resort to using the seeds as training or offering them as special treats. , since this is the time for new year’s resolutions, this is one you can have for feeding your pet bird. clean eating helps everyone to live longer. some species of birds are very prone to heart disease and others develop cancers when fed high-fat diets, so one of the best things you can do to keep your beloved bird healthy is to feed her healthy bird food. , ",Tips for Transitioning Your Bird to a New Bird Food,How To Feed A Bird Properly,Birds,314,351
"how to help an injured bird petmd.com /bird/care/evr_bd_how-to-help-an-injured-bird by julie doherty many an animal lover has crossed paths with an injured bird that appears to be in pain and is suffering. despite the very best intentions, rescuers are often at a loss for the best way to handle the situation and can even end up doing more harm than good. here are some action steps for getting the bird the care it needs. buz marthaler, co-founder of the wild life rehabilitation center of north utah, suggests treating the situation with the same urgency you would if a child had fractured an arm or leg, suffered head trauma or was bitten by an animal. since broken bird bones can begin healing incorrectly very quickly, hours count. “in all cases, it is always best to contact a local licensed wildlife rehabber so you can relay the pertinent information to them and they can figure out what is best,” marthaler said. depending on the bird, you or it can become seriously injured if you don’t know what you’re doing, marthaler said, adding that some birds that appear injured turn out not to be. when handling birds with large, sharp beaks (such as herons or loons), a caregiver may suffer serious eye injury if the bird feels threatened or hurt. if caution is ignored, birds of prey with sharp talons can easily puncture and hold on to human flesh. and then there is the issue of age. while it’s fine to carefully place a baby bird that’s been pushed out of its nest back in its nest, some birds (like fledglings, young birds that have just become able to fly) need to be left alone so their parents can care for them. in such a situation, pet owners should keep unattended dogs and cats indoors for 24 to 72 hours. “by then the youngster should be off the ground and fine,” marthaler said.",How to Help an Injured Bird,How to Help an Injured Bird,Birds,319,366
"the best way to transport a bird while it’s illegal to care for any wild native bird unless you’re licensed to do so, you are permitted to transport sick, injured and orphaned wildlife, marthaler said. if you are instructed by an expert to transport an injured bird, there are a few dos and don’ts to getting it safely to its destination, according to marthaler: never place food or water in the mouth of an injured animal, bird or otherwise. place the bird in a box or tote bag that’s been lined with paper towels to prevent them from slipping. use a secure cover to block out light, sound and the prying eyes of other animals and kids, as stress-producing disturbances can be deadly. “once it’s in the box, it’s best not to open it again,” marthaler said. “it is still best to see if it ‘made it’ once in the hands of a qualified rehabber.” , be mindful of temperature, particularly when dealing with a baby bird, which will likely need to be kept warm. “do not let it get too hot or too cold,” he says. “placing the box near a car’s a/c vent in the summer on the trip to the rehabber is not a good idea, but near the heat vent in the winter may be helpful.”",The Best Way to Transport a Bird,How to Help an Injured Bird,Birds,220,258
"preventing bird injuries unfortunately, many birds receive injuries as a result of people themselves, and these injuries are often preventable. “we receive hundreds of healthy baby birds every year [that have been injured] due to human impact such as pruning trees and shrubs during the breeding season,” marthaler said. he suggests pruning during the fall, and if that’s not possible, to carefully inspect the area that’s to be pruned for things like hummingbird nests, which are small. he also recommends repairing damaged house soffits and siding and filling or covering holes and cracks that will allow access to house and replacing or repairing damaged dryer vents that allow birds access for nesting. if a nest is in the way and appears to be home to young birds, marthaler recommends waiting a couple of weeks before removing it. “robins, sparrows and finches are all gone from the nest within 14 days of hatching,” he says. “the trick is to destroy the nest as soon as the babies have left. they won’t be coming back, but the parents may lay more eggs for another go-round. destroying the nest will force them to nest elsewhere and you can get that project done without harming them.” marthaler also suggests keeping cats, who are also a cause of wild bird injuries, indoors at all times. / , ",Preventing Bird Injuries,How to Help an Injured Bird,Birds,222,252

"how to choose a bird cage size entire rooms can be ‘bird-proofed’ and arranged for living quarters, dvm dr. patricia latas said, but for birds that will be housed in cages, she recommends investing in the largest cage one can buy. potential owners should also consider buying their bird two cages, one for daytime use and another for sleeping that can be kept in a quiet, dark space, she said. if your bird is going to be allowed to have free range of a room all day, it should be caged in a safe, dark place for at least 10 to 12 hours at night. the association of avian veterinarians (aav) says that bird cages need to be at least wide enough to accommodate stretched wings, but tall enough for long tailed birds. the bird needs enough room to be able to walk around and flap its wings vigorously without hitting them on anything. bird toys, food bowls and bird perches need to be taken into considering for occupying space. a good rule of thumb, said dr. latas, is to allow for no fewer than 18 inches by 18 inches of floor space per bird, with medium birds requiring at least 24 inches by 30 inches and large birds needing even more space. “a bird cage should be longer than they are tall because birds fly from side to side, not up and down,” dr. latas said. “canaries and finches particularly like to fly back and forth from perch to perch. vertical cages are unstable and can fall over easily.” potential bird owners must also plan on their bird spending time outside of its cage. “there should be ample play time outside of the cage, and this may include climbing stands, trees, play gyms, obstacle courses and human interaction,” she said. bar spacing can be potentially hazardous and even deadly if bars allow for a bird’s head to become lodged, so owners should pay special attention to a cage’s bars. for small birds, the spacing should be no more than half an inch. “with larger birds, it is important for the bars to be strong enough so that they cannot bend them with their beaks,” latas said, adding that bars should not converge, as is the case with domed cages. avoiding them will help prevent birds from getting a foot , or even their neck caught in the narrowing angles. certain bar materials such as hardware cloth, chicken wire or other galvanized metal should also be avoided since birds may peck at it and ingest it, which can lead to zinc or lead poisoning, latas said.",How to Choose a Bird Cage Size,How to Set Up the Perfect Bird Cage,Birds,436,494
"can birds live together? when deciding on whether or not your bird will should have a companion, dr. latas said that potential pet parents should always consult an experienced bird veterinarian for their advice before purchasing multiple birds. “the answer to this depends entirely on the species, age, living arrangements, background and temperament of the individual bird,” she said. “for example, a large, naturally furnished outdoor aviary may be able to house a number of birds, but small cages and human-bonded birds may not accept a new ‘friend.’ a cage full of birds may seem pleasing but if they are fighting, picking each other’s features or falling ill, there are too many.” certain types of birds can even become murderous towards one another, she added.",Can Birds Live Together?,How to Set Up the Perfect Bird Cage,Birds,125,148
"where to place your bird cage the aav recommends placing your bird cage in the area of the home where most of the family activity takes place, but latas cautions against kitchens, garages and workshops with fumes. your bird should be where activity in your home takes place but also away from danger, she added. although a room with a view to the outdoors is preferable, owners should move the cage if they feel that nearby activity is too stressful for their pet and it should be kept away from windows and drafts. “a bird is stressed if subjected to constant observation,” dr. latas said. “in the wild, the common species of companion birds are preyed upon by raptors and other animals and are sensitive to extended periods of a watchful gaze. they may also panic when a hawk flies by, especially if their cage sits directly in front of a window. large objects like balloons or an overhead lamp above their cage can have the same stressful, frightening effect.” at night, a bird’s cage should be covered or moved to a dark, quiet room so that they may get the 12 to 14 hours of sleep they require.",Where to Place your Bird Cage,How to Set Up the Perfect Bird Cage,Birds,199,221
"furniture and accessories for birds when it comes to perches, the aav recommends appropriately sized, clean natural wood branches from pesticide free and non-toxic trees. your bird’s nails should reach about halfway around the perch and not all the way around, said latas, who recommends placing a diversity of sizes of wood and rope or concrete perches in the cage. , “the location needs to be comfortable to perch high, fly, climb and maneuver but allow them to be able to get to their food and water dishes,” she said. shallow, low bowls that are impermeable and difficult to break, such as ceramic or stainless steel bowls, are recommended for food and water. owners should ensure that food dishes are placed in a spot away from bird droppings and are cleaned on a daily basis with hot water and dish soap. toys are also important for the mental health, welfare and well being of companion birds, latas said. she recommends non- toxic toys and encourages the use of games, books and other enrichment activities.",Furniture and Accessories for Birds,How to Set Up the Perfect Bird Cage,Birds,174,198
"cage cleaning considerations since birds are susceptible to mold and bacteria, cages must be kept in a clean room and cleaned weekly with hot water, dish detergent and good old fashioned elbow grease, latas said. on the rare occasion that a disinfectant is required, a veterinarian should prescribe an appropriate and safe product, she added. “not all disinfectants kill all pathogens and some are very dangerous. vinegar is not a disinfectant. bleach is very dangerous for humans, birds and the environment and should never be used without strict instructions from a veterinarian,” she said. cage bottoms should be lined with sheets of newspaper, butcher paper or paper towels (not shredded paper) and should be replaced at least daily or more frequently if needed, latas said. “avoid nugget materials like corncob bedding and walnut shells,” she said. “birds can ingest these, resulting in impaction. some of these materials are highly toxic and have heavy loads of bacterial and fungal spores and they hinder inspection of droppings, which is important in monitoring daily health.” if cage grates (which allow droppings and food to fall out of a bird’s reach) are used, the paper should be changed and the grate wiped down daily and the tray should be cleaned weekly, latas said. , ",Cage Cleaning Considerations,How to Set Up the Perfect Bird Cage,Birds,210,240

"how to discourage your bird from biting birds are great at sensing human emotions and they can tell when a human is afraid of them. to discourage your bird from biting when you are trying to get it to step-up onto your hand, you must present your hand in a confident, firm manner, in front of and just below the bird’s belly, where its body meets its legs. you should say, “step up,” in a clear voice, using the same tone and volume each time you ask. you must hold your hand steady and not waiver, even if the bird reaches down first with its beak to pull itself up onto your hand. holding steady is key; you wouldn’t want to step onto a platform if it were moving back and forth, so why should your bird? if the bird does grasp your hand firmly with its beak as it steps up, you must not pull away from it or yell, as this simply teaches your bird to be afraid of your moving hand—and of you as you scream. all it takes is one episode for a bird reaching out to step onto a hand that is pulled away, causing the bird to fall, or one time for a bird using its beak to pull itself onto a hand and being startled by a scream to teach the bird to fear the hand the next time. if you are not comfortable presenting your hand to a bird to step-up, you can try , using a perch or other stick, rather than your hand, for the bird to step-up on, but the perch also must be presented in a firm, unwavering manner, or the bird will learn to fear the perch.",How to Discourage Your Bird from Biting,How to Teach a Bird Not to Bite,Birds,290,325
"to prevent biting: it’s all in the body language just like people, birds have moods and opinions and should be allowed to express their choices. since most birds cannot speak words to communicate, understanding their body language is key to communicating with them and predicting when they might bite. when birds do not feel like moving from their perch onto a hand or another perch, they will often lean forward, puff out their feathers, dilate their pupils, and open their beaks slightly. these are all signs that the bird doesn’t want to step-up at that moment. if you see your bird acting this way, it’s best to back off and not to force it to step-up at that time. give the bird a break for a few minutes and try again. sometimes just allowing your bird to control when to step-up, rather than persistently trying to make it step-up, makes the whole process smoother. finally, while some birds recognize their owners’ hands as safe and will step-up onto them willingly, many birds will be fearful of strangers’ hands. therefore, no matter how relaxed or friendly your bird may seem around unfamiliar people, guests should never be permitted to reach out and touch your bird, particularly if they are unsupervised, or they may get bitten.",To Prevent Biting: It’s All in the Body Language,How to Teach a Bird Not to Bite,Birds,214,249

"how do you train a bird? the first step in training your bird is forming a strong relationship with them. in the very beginning, this may mean spending time together, playing with your bird, and offering treats. your bird will need to trust you and want to spend time with you in order to start training. if your bird is shy or skittish, it’s important to work on confidence and acceptance into the human flock first, before tackling any significant training. the first thing to teach your bird is the command “step up.” this is important for all birds to know and is the baseline for more advanced training. in fact, this command could prove lifesaving for your bird down the line, as this trick is especially helpful when bringing your bird to the vet or administering treatment. “step up” is simply the act of having your pet step onto your hand.",How Do You Train a Bird?,How To Train a Bird,Birds,152,171
"how to teach your bird “step up” 1. start with the bird on a perch or other curved surface. 2. press your finger gently against the bird’s lower chest/belly so that they feel a little off balance. they will generally lift one foot when they are looking for security; this gives you the opportunity to put your finger under the foot and lift gently. 3. as you lift, say the command “step up”. when you repeat this multiple times every day, your bird will start to associate the command with what you want him to do—step up onto your hand. 4. remember, you need to keep your hand very steady for this to work. if you are nervous or afraid of your bird, they will be scared too. confidence is contagious! , 5. keep in mind, you must teach your bird to step up to either hand. since birds are creatures of habit, show them that this command works in a variety of different scenarios 6. once your bird will perform the command consistently with you, start to teach them to step up with other members of the family and friends. once your bird has learned “step up” onto your hand, you can start having them step up onto a stick. sometimes, the biggest challenge here is getting your bird used to and comfortable with the stick, and this can take time. gradually move the stick closer to the cage and eventually into the cage for the bird to explore. never push your bird into the next step of training; it will only move you backwards in the long run. these basic training steps can be used to slowly teach your bird more useful commands, such as returning to their cage or a specific place, potty training, and basic bird manners.",How to Teach Your Bird “Step Up”,How To Train a Bird,Birds,301,343
"teaching your bird more advanced skills once your bird can reliably step up and has learned some basic bird manners, it’s time to consider teaching tricks. this might include talking, which many people enjoy and is perhaps the easiest trick to teach. 1. pick a very easy word or phrase to start with, such as your bird’s name, or “hello!” 2. repeat the phrase over and over—repetition is the key to your bird learning the word. 3. consider using a cd or tape recorder to allow your bird to hear the word even more frequently. 4. be patient. human speech is not natural for birds, and some can take a very long time to learn words and phrases. once they learn one, however, it does get easier to learn more words. if your bird isn’t learning quickly, consider teaching him how to whistle first. it can take months for a bird to learn words, so be patient. other tricks to teach your bird might include: waving dancing , spinning turning around playing “dead” taking a bow fetch all training takes time and patience with a bird that is interested and eager to learn. birds can learn to do just about anything that dogs can do so use your imagination and keep those tricks coming. remember to circle back and revisit “old” tricks as well, to keep them fresh and top of mind. your bird will never stop amazing you with what they can learn. , ",Teaching Your Bird More Advanced Skills,How To Train a Bird,Birds,245,281
"how to treat a bird’s broken beak petmd.com /bird/conditions/traumatic/broken-and-injured-beak-birds how birds use their beaks a bird’s beak consists of the bones of the upper (mandible) and lower (maxilla) jaws, which are covered by a layer of connective tissue (the dermis and epidermis) and a hard, keratin protein outer covering. several blood vessels and nerves supply the different parts of the beak, and parrots have a concentration of nerve endings near the tip of the beak, called the bill tip organ, that makes the beak very sensitive to temperature and pressure changes. birds’ beaks function like mammals’ lips and teeth; they grasp and crush food, and they vary in shape and size from species to species. beaks are also used to manipulate objects, aid in defense, explore surroundings, build nests, and preen.",How to Treat a Bird’s Broken Beak How Birds Use Their Beaks,How to Treat a Birds Broken Beak,Birds,131,161
"beaks never stop growing while the bones of the beak grow only until the adult beak size is reached, the keratin protein continuously grows in parrots from the base of the beak, nearest to the face, out toward the tip at a rate of ¼ to ½ inch per month. pet birds that use their beaks to grasp food, climb, and manipulate objects will naturally wear down the tips and sides of their beaks as they grow, eliminating the need for beak trimming. injuries to the base of the beak, nearest to the face, may inhibit regrowth.",Beaks Never Stop Growing,How to Treat a Birds Broken Beak,Birds,97,108
"what causes beak injuries? birds that use their beaks to help them climb around their bird cages or that chew on cage bars or hard wood may occasionally chip off small pieces of the keratin outer- covering on the tips and sides of their beaks. this is normal and generally not a cause for alarm, as long as the chips to the beak are not too large, and as long as the bird continues to eat and act normally. severe beak injuries are commonly the result of direct trauma. they often suffer from beak punctures, crushing injuries, lacerations, bone fractures, dislocations/luxations, burns, and avulsions (the beak is detaching from the face). these traumas can occur as a result of attacks from other animals (e.g., cage mates, other household pets, wild animals) and blunt force contact (hitting walls, falling off perches). less commonly, beaks will have an abnormal appearance or shape due to congenital or genetic defects, malnutrition (most often from lack of protein and/or vitamins a and d, all essential to beak formation and growth), infection (with viruses, bacteria, fungus, or parasites), or cancerous growths. some systemic diseases, such as liver disease, can actually cause beaks to overgrow. , ",What Causes Beak Injuries?,How to Treat a Birds Broken Beak,Birds,199,239
"how to recognize an abnormal or injured bird beak some abnormal beaks are obviously not right, while others are harder to recognize as abnormal. congenital abnormalities are generally obvious and most often appear as either a malocclusion (misalignment) of the upper and lower beak, so that they don’t meet properly when the mouth closes; a scissor beak, where either the upper or lower beak deviates sideways, so that the two slide past each other like scissor blades; or a mandibular prognathism, in which the tip of the upper beak rests inside the lower beak. dislocated beaks typically affect the top beak and result from a forced hyperextension of the joint joining the maxillary bone to the skull. birds with maxillary dislocations cannot close their mouths completely, have difficulty eating, and are visibly painful. the upper beak looks shifted upward, and in some cases, the jaw bone may be fractured. beaks that are soft, misshapen, or have a chipped or discolored surface can be the result of malnutrition. infected beaks may also appear chipped, discolored, pitted, grooved, or dry and flaky. fresh injuries may be painful and interfere with the bird’s ability to eat, while older injuries that have already started to heal may not significantly affect the bird. beak punctures, crushing wounds, and lacerations may extend only through the surface keratin protein or may penetrate deeper into underlying bone. pieces of keratin may break off, exposing bone underneath. there may be bleeding or scabbing, depending on when the injury occurred. burns to the beak typically initially look red and inflamed and ultimately turn black and scabbed as the burned tissue starts to die off. beak avulsions (separations) are easy to recognize, as either the upper, lower, or both parts of the beak are pulled partially or completely away from the face. finally, cancerous growths may appear as raised lesions on the beak from just beneath the nostrils, where beak meets skin, all the way to the tip.",How to Recognize an Abnormal or Injured Bird Beak,How to Treat a Birds Broken Beak,Birds,327,373
"how to treat a bleeding beak a bleeding beak must be treated immediately. for serious bleeding, owners may need to control bleeding at home before they can get their birds to a veterinarian. , bird owners may want to keep powdered clotting agents and a styptic pencil on hand in case a bird has a bleeding beak or bleeding toenail at home. minor bleeding may be halted with the application of pressure to the bleeding spot (such as with a paper towel or small cloth). more significant bleeding may require the application of a powdered clotting agents, the kind typically used on bleeding toenails, or a styptic pencil. to protect the injured bird from ingesting the clotting agent or styptic, these substances are usually gently flushed off with water once the bleeding has stopped and a clot has formed. beaks contain many blood vessels and nerves; thus, beak injuries can result in significant bleeding and pain in some cases, inhibiting a bird’s ability to eat. birds with bleeding or very painful beaks and those that are not eating should be examined by a veterinarian right away. those with large open wounds, burns, or obvious fractures where bone is exposed, and those with avulsions or dislocations should also be treated as quickly as possible.",How to Treat a Bleeding Beak,How to Treat a Birds Broken Beak,Birds,213,234
"medical treatment for beak injury whenever an owner notices anything different about his or her bird’s beak, a veterinary appointment should be made to have it checked out. some beak abnormalities require immediate veterinary attention, while others are less emergent. minor beak injuries may be simple to treat, while severe beak-trauma may not be treatable. an avian-savvy veterinarian can determine a treatment course after performing a full physical examination. birds with slowly developing beak changes (such as surface discoloration or pitting) or slowly growing masses on the beak are not typically considered immediate emergencies, but should be seen by a veterinarian as soon as possible. wounds, burns, and fractures can easily become infected, especially if food gets packed into them. small wounds, lacerations, and burns may be cleaned with antiseptic and treated topically or systemically with antibiotics and anti-inflammatory medications and pain relievers. often, the keratin covering over the beak will grow back very slowly over weeks to months. large defects in keratin may need to be patched with acrylic. underlying damaged bone will not grow back in an adult bird. severe crushing injuries, fractures, and dislocations may require surgical repair and administration of medications long term. certain congenital abnormalities may require surgical repair as well. suspected beak infections must be biopsied and cultured so that proper medications (i.e., antibiotics vs. antifungal drugs) can be administered. beak growths need to be biopsied and/or , removed as well, to determine what they are and how they should be treated (e.g., with chemotherapy, radiation, etc.). beaks that have been avulsed (or torn away from the face) may be surgically re- attached only if there is still a significant connection between the beak and face so that nerves and blood vessels are intact. often, avulsed beaks are not salvageable and must be removed. birds missing either the upper or lower beak sometimes can learn to eat on their own over time, but their owners must be prepared to hand-feed them for weeks to months as the birds learn to adapt. birds missing both upper and lower beaks generally cannot adapt and should be humanely euthanized. while beak prosthetics are available, they must be custom- made to fit an individual bird and surgically placed by a veterinarian. these prosthetics commonly fall off over time, particularly in growing or very active birds, and must be replaced as needed.",Medical Treatment for Beak Injury,How to Treat a Birds Broken Beak,Birds,393,453

"the soft and easy way to trim your bird’s nails some of the best things about having a bird for a pet is holding it on your hand, letting it hang out on your shoulders, even on your head, and listening to it chirp and chatter in your ear. birds, like humans, have nails, and when their nails get too long the experience can be annoying, if not painful, when the bird digs its little nails into our skin. fortunately, this is relatively easy to remedy, but you will need to plan ahead and have all of the tools necessary for the task. prepare for success: because you will need to wrap your bird in a towel for grooming, part of the planning includes getting your bird accustomed to towels. using a light colored towel -- bright colored towels might alarm your bird -- lay the towel on your hand and allow the bird to climb onto the towel, maybe with some little treats and ""good bird"" affirmations to encourage your bird to be comfortable with the towel. do this on a regular basis so that when it is time to use the towel, your bird will associate it with good times. tools of the trade: for g-day (grooming day), gather all your grooming materials and ask a friend or family member to help (it is best if your bird is already familiar with the person). again, you don’t want your bird to be overly alarmed by the process. if you should happen to cut a little too close to the quick when clipping the nail, use styptic powder, an antihemorrhagic that stops excessive bleeding. the other essential tool is the specially designed nail clipper for birds. the size of the clipper will depend on whether you a small or large bird. for a small bird, a pair of nail scissors may work out well enough, but for a big bird, a clipper that can cut through the thicker nail quickly and cleanly will be essential. take control: begin by draping the towel over your bird’s back, leaving its head uncovered. as you wrap the towel around your bird’s body and take the bird into your hands, be sure that you are holding it firmly at its sides, taking care not to press against its chest. this is important because birds do not have a diaphragm, so putting too much pressure on the chest may cause them to suffocate. even the most domesticated birds can get a little upset by being wrapped up, so you will need to take control of your bird’s head to keep from being bitten. while holding the body with one hand, use your other hand to hold the bird’s head. place your thumb on one side of the bird’s head and your middle finger on the other, holding firmly enough to keep the bird from turning its head freely. maintain the bird's head still from the top with your index finger and reassure your bird with kind words to keep it calm. , clipping the nails: whether it is you, a friend, or family member that is trimming your bird's nails, the steps are the same. place one finger within reach of your bird’s feet so that it can grasp onto the finger. use your thumb to lift each nail off of your finger, clipping just a small amount of the nail. you can always clip a little more from the nail, but if you miss the mark and clip too much the first time, you will have a very freaked out and bleeding bird to deal with, which is dangerous, as birds can bleed to death from this type of injury if it is not handled quickly. to avoid this scenario, first identify where the edge of the nail meets the quick (you can usually see this with light colored nails, as the nail is white and the quick is pink). if your bird’s nails are dark, use extra care and trim just a little at a time. additionally, if your bird is handling the experience well, you may want to try smoothing out the edges of the nail with a nail file, but it is not necessary. what to watch out for: watch your bird closely as you are trimming its nails. you can expect your bird to be vocal about the indignity of the situation, often attempting to escape from your grasp. but if your bird appears to be having trouble breathing, is panting, is moving too much to keep a firm hold, or seems to have lost motor coordination -- like its eyes rolling back in its head -- stop immediately and place your bird back on its perch or in its cage and allow it to calm down, while speaking in a soothing tone. you can try to trim its nails again later, but if you encounter the same problems, have a skilled veterinarian or bird groomer do it for you. final tips: try to begin the nail trimming routine while your bird is young and use treats after the clipping so that your bird always associates this activity as a good thing. in between clips, place a sand or pumice stone perch (in addition to its natural wooden perch) in the cage. this will allow the bird to file its own nails and reduce the frequency of the nail clippings. in the wild, birds use both wood and stone to groom their own nails and beak, so having both for your bird will save you a lot of trouble in the long run. , ",The Soft and Easy Way to Trim

"choosing the right enclosure ideally, habitats should be at least 30” w x 24” d x 30” h for a single, medium-sized parakeet. the space between the cage’s bars should be a half-inch apart or smaller to prevent birds from escaping or getting their heads or legs stuck. it’s important to make sure that the enclosure has enough vertical height for the parakeet to stretch and perch comfortably without having their wings or tails contact any surface. always provide the largest habitat possible. homemade habitats or any habitat made with wood or galvanized wire are not recommended. these materials can expose birds to potentially toxic chemicals that can cause serious medical problems if ingested. setting up your habitat medium-sized parakeets are comfortable in average household temperatures from 65 f to 80 f. pet parents should be cautious of extreme temperature changes. keep habitats in a draft-free, well-lit area that is not accessible to other pets, including cats and dogs. pet parents should make sure that no habitat parts or toys are made with lead, zinc, lead-based paints, galvanized metal, or other potentially toxic materials. all these materials can cause serious medical issues if ingested. medium-sized parakeets can be raised alone or alongside another parakeet to form a bonded pair. since they can be territorial, it’s best to introduce parakeets to each other at a young age if they’re going to be housed in the same habitat. in all cases, introductions must be done slowly and under close supervision to ensure the birds are compatible. if the two parakeets fight, separate them. different species of birds should never be kept in the same habitat. pet parents who choose to house their medium-sized parakeet alone should make sure that they have plenty of time to interact with their bird each day, or the parakeet will become bored and may develop destructive behaviors such as feather-picking and screaming.",Choosing the Right Enclosure Setting Up Your Habitat,Medium Parakeet Care Sheet,Birds,315,360
"bedding and lighting the bottom of a parakeet's habitat should have a removable metal grate so droppings can fall below the bird’s feet. pet parents should line the tray at the base of the habitat with habitat paper or other paper-based bedding. this will help keep the environment clean and minimize dust. , birds need exposure to ultraviolet (uv) light to produce vitamin d in their skin so they can absorb dietary calcium. glass windows filter out uv light, so placing a parakeet’s habitat next to an indoor window is not enough. instead, birds can get natural uv exposure by spending time outside in an escape- proof outdoor cage when weather permits. birds should never be left unattended while outside and should not be placed in direct sunlight. to supplement uv exposure, pet parents can shine a full-spectrum uv light designed for birds on their parakeet's habitat for 10–12 hours each day. uv lights should be about 12–18 inches away from where the bird perches. lights should be replaced every six months because their potency wanes over time.",Bedding and Lighting,Medium Parakeet Care Sheet,Birds,178,201
"décor and accessories perches : pet parents should install perches of various heights, textures, and materials into their parakeet’s cage so the bird can exercise their feet and prevent pressure sores from developing. perches should be at least 5 inches long and about a half-inch in diameter. if a perch’s diameter is too wide, the bird will not be able to grip it properly. this can lead to falls and serious injury. sandpaper perches and sanded perch covers are not recommended because they can cause painful abrasions on the underside of a bird’s feet. gravel-coated perches should be avoided because they are abrasive to birds’ feet, and birds can pick off the gravel and ingest it. do not place perches above the bird’s water or food bowl—waste droppings will land there. toys : medium-sized parakeets are very intelligent, so pet parents can place a variety of appropriately sized toys in their enclosure to encourage exercise and provide entertainment. without adequate mental and physical stimulation, birds can grow bored and develop harmful habits, like feather-plucking. toys should be made from cardboard, paper, soft wood, or plastic too hard for parakeets to chew off and ingest. they should be rotated regularly to prevent boredom. however, since birds are creatures of habit and are sometimes stressed by change, new toys should be introduced one at a time. ensure that toys are securely attached to the inside of the habitat. sometimes, birds can unscrew the c-clamps that are commonly used to hang toys if they aren’t secured properly, and this can lead to injury. , water and food dishes : dry food, fresh food, and water should all be offered in separate dishes. if more than one parakeet is kept in the same habitat, then each bird should have its own feeding station to discourage competition. water dishes should be large enough for the parakeet to bathe in. dishes should be washed and rinsed thoroughly each day to prevent bacterial growth. cuttlebone : egg-laying female parakeets should always have access to at least one cuttlebone. cuttlebones are an excellent way to supplement calcium and other beneficial minerals in a bird’s diet. calcium is a vital nutrient that promotes healthy egg production and helps keep birds’ bones, beaks, nails, and feathers strong and healthy. a cuttlebone holder, like the jw® pet insight cuttlebone holder bird toy, can help keep a bird’s cuttlebone in place and prevent cuttlebone debris from falling outside the cage.",Décor and Accessories,Medium Parakeet Care Sheet,Birds,408,469

"medium parakeet diet and nutrition medium-sized parakeets enjoy a range of foods, including pelleted food, seed, vegetables, fruits, and the occasional treat. parakeets should always have access to fresh, clean water. pet parents should never share food from their mouths or plates with their parakeet. human mouths have microorganisms that can cause illness in birds. a nutritious and well-balanced diet for a medium-sized parakeet includes a high- quality pelleted food formulated for medium parakeets. a nutritionally complete and balanced pelleted food should make up at least 60–70% of a parakeet’s diet. use the manufacturer's instructions to determine how much food should be given daily. uneaten food should be discarded and replaced before each feeding. vegetables, fruits, and other table foods should be offered in limited quantities (not more than 30% of the total diet), with treats (including seed) not making up more than 10% of the total diet. parakeets enjoy and can safely eat a variety of fresh fruits and small amounts of vegetables, including: berries melons papaya potatoes bell peppers broccoli pea pods uneaten fruits and vegetables should be discarded after a few hours. fortified seeds and millet can be fed as a treat. like other parrots, parakeets remove the hulls of seeds before eating them, so pet parents do not need to give them a grit supplement to help them grind down whole seeds. , fresh, clean water should be changed daily. do not allow parakeets to ingest avocados, fruit seeds, chocolate, caffeine, or alcohol, as they are all toxic and can cause serious illness or death. pet parents should avoid treats high in salt or fat.",Medium Parakeet Diet and Nutrition,Medium Parakeet Care Sheet,Birds,269,315

"should i shoulder-train my bird? “most avian experts agree that sitting on a shoulder is not the best option for most birds,” said jacqueline johnson, manager of the parrot garden at best friends animal society in kanab, utah. she mentions netherlands-based avian behaviorist dr. jan hooimeijer, who believes that allowing birds on a shoulder may foster insecurity in the bird. “birds can be prone to redirection,” explained johnson, “so if they are frightened, you can take a nasty face bite.” another reason, she says, is that unless a bird is exceptionally well-behaved and bonded, “it will play keep-away when you are trying to get it to step up from your shoulder.” imagine how frustrating it would be to wrangle with your bird while it is hanging off the middle of your back—a common situation bird owners find themselves in. so, “unless your bird will step-up immediately when asked, a shoulder is not recommended,” said johnson. of johnson’s seven birds that she personally owns, she said only two are allowed “shoulder privileges,” as she calls it.",Should I shoulder-train my bird?,Shoulder Training Birds,Birds,175,212
"how can i train my bird outside of the cage? instead of shoulder training, johnson and her team strongly suggest people teach their birds to step-up onto a hand—and stay there. “if you hold your arm perpendicular to the floor, with your elbow tucked into your side,” she explained, “it makes it easy to keep a bird from running up your arm to your shoulder.” the first method for achieving a hand “step-up”—if your bird doesn’t already understand this command—is to convince the bird to take a treat from your hand, explained johnson. “i recommend finding [your bird’s] very favorite treat and using that for training sessions.” , “then, over time, you convince the bird to step up on the opposite arm to get the treat, by holding the treat over your arm and luring it,” she said. it doesn't take long to teach a bird, “because of their high degree of intelligence and reasoning skills,” she added. johnson recommends only positive reinforcement be used for training, “or you can irreparably damage your relationship [with your bird].”",How can I train my bird outside of the cage?,Shoulder Training Birds,Birds,177,214
"watch your bird’s body language as with training any animal, keeping a close eye on your feathered friend’s body language is key. “birds do a lot of their communicating via body language,” explained johnson. “in fact, one of the main causes of bird bites is a failure to pay attention to what your bird is telling you,” she added. while each species has differences, there are some general signs that your bird has had enough. “almost all [birds] will lean towards the cage and start acting like they are trying to get the courage to fly back to it,” said johnson. this may include flicking their wings at the shoulder (like a fast shrugging motion), she said. “if you immediately take the bird back [to its cage] when you see this behavior, it will help teach [your bird] that you understand, and that it’s safe with you,” she said.",Watch your bird’s body language,Shoulder Training Birds,Birds,149,177
"what are the risks of shoulder or hand-training a bird? the reason johnson and her team recommend hand training versus shoulder training is due to the known risks. birds are prey species; when startled—be it by a loud noise or sudden movement— they are hardwired to flee first, said johnson. this could be detrimental for your bird, especially if it has the freedom to fly around the house, since it can escape the safe confines of home through an open door or window. many birds are lost every year in this way. even the most mentally well-balanced bird can startle and panic, and clipped wings are no guarantee of safety, she added. “even if a bird's wings have been clipped, it can fly, to a certain extent,” she explained. in addition, she said, even trained birds should not be taken outside while perched on your arm. “we recommend never taking your bird outside unless it is in a carrier or wearing a bird harness,” said johnson. apart from the risk to your bird, there is also the risk to your own body. “birds can be curious,” which means they may pull your hair, bite your ears, and chew or tug on your jewelry, said johnson. she suggests making bird-friendly jewelry to wear around your neck for when your bird is sitting with you — birdie necklaces strung with bird-safe toys on a bird-safe chain or rope for the bird to play with. , and, of course, while not life endangering, there is also the possibility that your bird will poop on your shoulder, ruining your favorite shirt! if you do allow your bird to hang out on your shoulder, a “poop cloth” (aka a shoulder cape, available from many pet supplies) draped over your shoulder is highly advised. , ",What are the risks of shoulder or hand-training a bird?,Shoulder Training Birds,Birds,299,349

"the 4 critical commands your bird needs to learn petmd.com /bird/training/four-most-important-things-your-bird-needs-know by dr. laurie hess, dvm, diplomate abvp (avian practice) pet birds — especially parrots — are incredibly smart and can actually learn words and basic commands to communicate with their owners. birds benefit from this communication not only by helping them bond to their caretakers, but also by enabling their caretakers to take better care of them and to keep them safe. while some parrots, such as alex the famous african gray parrot owned by dr. irene pepperberg, have been taught to respond to dozens of commands and have learned hundreds of words, most birds will grasp a few basic commands that all bird owners should be able to teach them with time and patience. here are the four basic commands that all pet birds should be taught.",The 4 Critical Commands Your Bird Needs to Learn,The 4 Critical Commands Your Bird Needs to Learn,Birds,139,162
"“step up” all bird owners would love to be able to open the door to their bird’s cage and have their bird come right out, onto their hands. while some birds will do this naturally, many birds need to overcome the fear associated with stepping on to an often unsteady human hand and be taught the value of going directly to their owners. birds who are involved in an activity in the cage, such as eating or resting or playing with toys, may not want to be interrupted and asked to leave the cage. for some birds, the cage is a safe place and a domain over which they feel they should have full control. furthermore, birds, like people, have moods, and sometimes they just don’t feel like doing what their owners want them to. to get a bird to come to you, you have to make stepping on to your hand more valuable than whatever the bird is doing in the cage. the way to do that is to initially pair the bird’s sight of your hand and hearing “step up” with receiving a special treat (such as a small piece of a favorite food) that he gets at no other time other than when he sees your hand at the open cage door. the open palm of your non-treat bearing hand should be placed between the bird standing at the cage door and the hand holding the treat. initially, the bird is given the treat for simply coming to the cage door when you open it and hearing the words “step up.” you should also praise your bird verbally by saying either “good bird” or his name when he comes to the cage door. after the bird masters coming to the door of the cage reliably, the stakes are raised and he only gets the treat and the verbal praise when he responds to “step up” by leaning his weight with one foot on the open palm of your non-treat bearing hand. next, once the bird has grasped that concept reliably, you raise the bar once again , and give him the treat and the verbal praise after you say “step up” only when he actually stands with both feet on the non-treat bearing palm between the cage door and the treat hand. finally, once he understands that step, you then give him the treat and the praise only after you say “step up” and he not only steps with both feet onto the open palm of your non-treat bearing hand, but also allows you to move your hand, with him on it, away from the cage. as soon as he does that, he gets several pieces of treat and lots of verbal praise (plus a scratch on the head, if he likes that) immediately after you move your hand with him on it away from the cage, so that he anticipates stepping on to your hand and moving away from the cage with the payoff of several treats. the key to teaching this step-up command is to practice every day for just a few minutes — only when the bird seems receptive — and to use the same tone of voice when saying “step up.” if your bird is distracted or tired, don’t push it; and be patient. teaching this command can take several weeks. also, be sure to use a treat that the bird gets at no other time either from you or from anyone else. ultimately, your bird will learn to anticipate the sight of your hand and your request for him to “step up” simply with verbal praise and a head scratch, so that you can phase out the treat. this process of teaching a new behavior in several small steps is called shaping the behavior.",“Step Up”,The 4 Critical Commands Your Bird Needs to Learn,Birds,632,699
"“step down” this command is taught the same way as the step-up command, except to teach the bird to go either back into his cage or onto another stable perch. the steps involved in teaching this command are the same as in teaching “step up”: using a special favorite treat that is not available at other times other than during training, plus verbal praise. in teaching this command, say “step down” and reward the bird with a treat and verbal praise for making contact initially with just one foot, and then ultimately with both feet, on the desired location (either inside the cage or at a perch outside the cage). if he steps on the desired location with both feet, he should receive the big bonus of several pieces of treat, plus verbal praise and a head scratch. the key again is to practice this command just a few minutes a day and only when the bird seems interested and receptive to treats. if you’re teaching “step up” and “step down” to a bird during different training sessions over the same period of days to weeks, ideally you should use one type of treat to train “step up” and another to train “step down” so that the bird learns to anticipate different rewards for different requests. eventually, you will be able to phase out the treat when he steps down, as he comes to anticipate stepping down with verbal praise and a head scratch. , ",“Step Down”,The 4 Critical Commands Your Bird Needs to Learn,Birds,245,273
"“touch foot” most people don’t realize the value in teaching their birds this command, but teaching a bird to accept having his feet touched is critical if you want to be able to trim his nails. the process involved in teaching this command is again the same as in teaching the bird to step up: you pair the command “touch foot” and the sight of the nail trimmer (or dremel drill, or whatever tool you use to trim nails) with receiving a special, favored treat not available at any time. then you only give the bird the treat, as well as verbal praise, when you say, “touch foot,” and you touch the nail trimmer briefly to his foot. next, you raise the bar, only rewarding him with treats and verbal praise if he allows you initially to hold the trimmer next to his foot for just a few seconds and then ultimately to touch his nails directly with the trimmer. you keep raising the bar gradually, increasing contact between his nails and the trimmer, until you only give him treats and verbal praise when he allows you to actually trim a nail. then he gets the big payoff of several treats, verbal praise, plus a head scratch. you may only be able to get your bird to allow one nail to be trimmed at a time, but eventually, with enough practice and continuous small treats and praise after each nail is cut, you will get through all the nails on both feet.",“Touch Foot”,The 4 Critical Commands Your Bird Needs to Learn,Birds,252,281
"“touch syringe” this command is a request that most bird owners never think of to train their birds but that can be tremendously valuable if your bird ever has to take medications. the idea is to get the bird to accept drinking a small amount of liquid from the tip of a plastic syringe without biting the syringe or your hand. the steps to shaping this behavior are the same as with the other behaviors described: rewarding each step in the training process with a special food treat and verbal praise. initially, the bird is given a small treat and verbal praise simply for looking at the syringe when you say “touch syringe.” then, you fill the syringe with a very small amount of a sweet-tasting liquid, such as apple or cranberry juice, and reward the bird with a treat and verbal praise after saying “touch syringe” and touching the tip of the syringe to his beak. after he masters that step, reward him with treats and praise only for allowing you to initially hold the syringe tip to his beak for a few seconds and then eventually for tasting a drop of the sweet liquid from the syringe. ultimately, if he takes the full amount of liquid from the syringe tip, give him the big payoff of several treats, verbal praise, plus a head scratch. if your bird masters this command, you should be able to medicate him with liquid medications (compounded with sweet flavoring) if you need to. this is an invaluable command that can be life-saving if the bird needs medical treatment. , these commands involve teaching a few simple behaviors that nearly all birds should be able to learn. the key for any bird owner teaching these commands is to be patient. birds may be receptive to training on some days and not others, just as people are. teaching a new behavior takes time but can be tremendously satisfying to both owner and bird once the bird gets it. , ",“Touch Syringe”,The 4 Critical Commands Your Bird Needs to Learn,Birds,334,365

"what is secondhand smoke? smokers—and people and pets exposed to smokers—are affected by smoke in different ways. here are the differences between firsthand, secondhand, and thirdhand smoke: firsthand smoke: firsthand smoke refers to the smoke inhaled directly by the smoker. when someone smokes a cigarette, cigar, or pipe, they draw the smoke into their lungs, which are exposed to a high concentration of toxic chemicals. this direct exposure is the primary cause of numerous smoking-related diseases and health issues. secondhand smoke: secondhand smoke, also known as environmental tobacco smoke (ets), is the combination of smoke exhaled by smokers and the smoke that comes from the burning end of a cigarette, cigar, or pipe. this smoke contains a mix of more than 7,000 mostly toxic and carcinogenic chemicals. when non-smokers and pets breathe in secondhand smoke, they are exposed to these harmful substances, which can have serious health consequences. thirdhand smoke: thirdhand smoke refers to the residual nicotine and other chemicals that remain on surfaces and in dust long after the smoker has left the area and the smoke has cleared. these residues can linger for long periods on furniture, walls, carpets, clothing, hair or fur, and other surfaces. pets can be exposed to these toxins by touching contaminated surfaces, licking their own fur, and breathing in these chemicals. the risk isn’t limited to tobacco smoke. , marijuana smoke contains many of the same harmful chemicals as tobacco smoke, as well as delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (thc), which can impair your pet’s cognitive function and potentially affect their cardiovascular health. vaping smoke contains fewer chemicals than tobacco smoke, but still includes harmful substances, such as nicotine and toxic compounds that form during heating. the long-term effects on pets aren’t fully understood, but vaping smoke does pose potential health risks.",What Is Secondhand Smoke?,The Effects of Secondhand Smoke on Pets,Birds,295,351

"human-food-only diet likewise, birds should not eat only human food. work with your veterinarian to determine the best diet for your pet bird. ideally, 80% of a pet bird’s diet should be formulated or extruded pellets, such as zupreem® bird foods or harrison’s bird foods. these diets are balanced to meet specific dietary vitamin and mineral requirements necessary for pet birds. while pellets should make up most of a pet bird’s diet, they can enjoy having tasty human food as treats. sharing snacks with their human family is a great way to train and bond with a pet bird. however, birds are not small humans (even though sometimes they talk just like us.) some foods are highly toxic in birds, resulting in long-term costly illness and even death. your veterinarian can help you determine which foods are best for your bird based on weight, species, and overall health. the following foods are considered toxic in all bird species and should be avoided: avocado leaves, fruit, stems, bark, and seeds are highly toxic to birds— especially the leaves. the specific toxin in avocado is called persin and causes heart conditions, respiratory distress, and death in birds. small birds (like canaries and budgies) may be more susceptible; however, avocado toxicity also occurs in other bird species. birds may show distress within hours of ingestion and die within 24–48 hours. , chocolate contains theobromine and caffeine, which are methylxanthines that can cause heart rate and rhythm changes, hyperactivity, seizures, and death. in general, the darker the chocolate, the higher the amount of toxins. fruit pits and seeds , including apples, cherries, apricot, plums, and peaches, should not be fed to birds due to their level of cyanide. many birds enjoy eating fruit, but pet parents should carefully remove all seeds or pits to prevent cyanide poisoning. onion and garlic toxicity is well documented in many mammal species including dogs and cats. in birds, too, onions and garlic can cause issues with blood cells, liver, and kidneys. high-fat and high-salt foods like sunflower seeds are some of a pet bird’s favorite foods. however, seeds are incredibly high in fat and equivalent to human fast food. prolonged exposure to high-fat and high-salt foods will have similar results in birds as in humans—heart disease, obesity, diabetes, and liver disease. xylitol is an artificial sweetener that causes severe low blood sugar and liver disease in dogs. there is limited data on the toxicity in most bird species, but it is generally assumed unsafe for birds. other food items that may not be inherently toxic but can still cause issues with pet birds include: birds are susceptible to mold , so foods such as peanuts, corn, and other grains are discouraged. dairy products should also be given in small amounts, as birds cannot process large amounts of lactose. certain plants in the nightshade family (tomatoes, potatoes, eggplant, and peppers) may be safe for birds to consume, but pet parents should observe not to feed any part of the plant.",Human-Food-Only Diet,Toxic Foods for Birds,Birds,501,593

"training your bird to fetch and other cool tricks petmd.com /bird/training/how-train-your-bird-fetch-and-other-fun-games by cheryl lock whether you’ve lived with birds all your life or your new friend is your first feathered companion, you’ve likely noticed that most domesticated birds love to play. but even playtime needs structure. in general, birds can learn new behaviors relatively quickly, says barbara heidenreich, an animal training and behavior consultant who has been working with birds for 27 years. “however, what really makes a difference is the skill level of the trainer,” she added. “animal training is really a form of communication, and it follows a very systematic approach,” heidenreich explained. “the better the person is at applying the training technology, the better he or she will communicate what is required to earn desired consequences.” being sensitive to body language and creating a relaxing and comfortable environment are integral steps to helping your bird to learn, heidenreich said. so how can you help your bird to learn tricks, even if it’s your first time? follow these steps.",Training Your Bird to Fetch and Other Cool Tricks,Training Your Bird to Fetch and Other Cool Tricks,Birds,171,208
"start with the basics before beginning to train any animal, it first needs to be relaxed and comfortable, says heidenreich. “i generally do not move an animal to a new space to train unless it’s a space with which [the animal] is already very familiar,” she said. “the next most important thing to do is to identify potential reinforcers.” a reinforcer is either a thing or experience your bird seeks to acquire or engage in, like preferred foods, toys, or physical affection.",Start With the Basics,Training Your Bird to Fetch and Other Cool Tricks,Birds,82,96
"choose your method of teaching very carefully in heidenreich’s experience, positive reinforcement has been the most effective training tool. “this means that whenever your animal presents the desired behavior, something good is going to happen, like the delivery of a desired treat, toy, or attention,” she said. “this method of teaching creates eager participants. it also fosters trust because parrots are empowered to choose to participate, and when they do, good things happen.” , dr. laurie hess, dvm, diplomate abvp (avian practice) of the veterinary center for birds & exotics, has a similar outlook on training. “the name of the training that we apply to birds is ‘applied behavior analysis,’ and it’s totally based on positive reinforcement,” she said.

"start out easy and build up if you’re a novice to training, avoid frustration by starting with the easiest tasks. “almost all animal training begins with target training,” said heidenreich. “this is a very simple behavior that involves teaching an animal to orient a body part towards something.” with a bird, heidenreich says she usually asks them to orient their beak towards the end of a stick or a closed fist (using a treat to entice them to do so). “doing this results in a desired consequence, and once a parrot has learned to target, the target can then be used to direct a parrot where to go without touching the bird.” this targeting method can be used to teach your bird to turn in a circle, step onto a scale, step onto a hand, go into a transport crate, or step back into their enclosure.",Start Out Easy and Build Up,Training Your Bird to Fetch and Other Cool Tricks,Birds,146,166
"take your new wisdom for a test drive here are three tricks many novices can follow. train your bird to retrieve (courtesy of heidenreich) , 1. set the bird on a small perch and offer a small toy — like a wooden bead (the type found in bird toys) — in your hand. usually birds will pick the toy up with their beaks out of curiosity. if yours doesn’t, try hiding a piece of food behind the bead so the bird must touch the bead with its beak. say “good” to reinforce when the bird touches the bead with its beak. continue approximating the retrieving behavior (a process called “shaping” the behavior) by rewarding your bird each time it touches the bead until the bird actually picks it up. 2. hold a small bowl under the bird’s beak. eventually the bird will tire of the bead and drop it. catch the bead in the bowl. say the word “good” when the bead hits the bowl. offer a reinforcer. repeat this process several times. 3. after several repetitions, move the bowl slightly to the side. the bird will probably not drop the bead in the bowl. offer the bead again, and allow the bird to miss one or two times without reinforcing. 4. go back to trying to catch the bead in the bowl. say “good” and reinforce. 5. try moving the bowl to the side again. if the bird gets the bead in the bowl, offer lots of reinforcement. if it misses, go back to step 3 and work up to step 5 again. keep repeating this process until the bird understands the bead must go into the bowl in order to get the reinforcer. 6. once the bird gets the concept of the bead going into the bowl, start moving the bowl a little farther away. you will find you may have to go through steps 3-7 again. but eventually, you will be able to hold the bead on one end of the perch and the bowl on the other. 7. once the bird understands this concept, you can try switching the object to something else. to do this, go back to holding the bowl under the bird’s beak and catching the object, gradually moving the bowl farther away. this should go quickly this time. once the concept is well understood, try placing the bird and bowl on another surface, such as a table. again, you may need to repeat steps 3-7 to get on track, but eventually the bird will learn to generalize and perform the behavior in different environments and with different objects.",Take Your New Wisdom for a Test Drive Train your bird to retrieve,Training Your Bird to Fetch and Other Cool Tricks,Birds,436,498

"chickens have specific housing requirements chickens are appealing as pets to some people because many chicken coops are designed to look like decorative houses that are attractive additions to the yard. however, chickens have very particular housing needs, and some of these designer coops are not constructed to meet these needs. chickens need sunlight for example, not all chicken coops are heated, yet chickens housed outdoors in cold climates need heat when it’s very cold so that they don’t get frostbitten. similarly, chickens that are housed inside continuously over cold winters lack exposure to the sun’s ultraviolet (uv) rays, which are critical to helping them make vitamin d in their skin. vitamin d enables chickens to absorb calcium from their food so that they can make hard-shelled eggs. without adequate uv light exposure, chickens often lay soft or shell-less eggs or have eggs get stuck inside of them when they try to lay—a life- threatening condition called egg-binding. this happens because their uterine muscles run out of the calcium needed to push the eggs out. consequently, chickens living indoors in cold climates must have uv light bulbs built into their coops so that they don’t lay abnormal eggs or become egg-bound. chickens need nesting boxes in addition, chickens will only lay eggs if they are provided with boxes in which they can nest. coops should have one box for every four to five chickens for optimal egg- laying. nest boxes ideally should be placed in the least-trafficked part of the coop to prevent disturbing hens while they are laying, and they should be elevated 1-3 feet off the floor to prevent predators from jumping in them and debris from the coop floor collecting in them. nest boxes should be lined with bedding (pine shavings or straw hay) to keep chickens comfortable and to protect eggs once they are laid, and the boxes should be cleaned out regularly. coops should be spot-cleaned daily and fully swept out weekly, and they should be placed outside in areas where the top layer of soil can be , raked up and removed at least once a year. this prevents chickens from ingesting parasite eggs that are passed into the soil in their droppings and re-ingested, thereby perpetuating the parasite infection cycle. chickens need a fenced-in area to roam in addition to a coop, chickens need a safe, fenced-in area outside to roam and exercise in when there’s good weather. fences must extend both high above and deep below ground to prevent predators from jumping over and digging under them to get inside. chickens must also be provided with mental stimulation and environmental enrichment so that they don’t feather-pick or bully each other. enrichment may be offered in the form of perches of different heights, tunnels made from cardboard boxes, compost piles to dig in, and hanging vegetables, like heads of cabbage or lettuce, that they can peck. other favorites for chickens include toys such as mirrors and rope swings, bins filled with sand to bathe in, and insects such as mealworms to snack on.",Chickens Have Specific Housing Requirements,What You Should Know Before Getting Backyard Chickens,Birds,510,573

"why do birds need their wings clipped? petmd.com /bird/grooming/how-clip-birds-wings by laurie hess, dvm, diplomate abvp (avian practice) note: before attempting to clip a bird’s wings, an owner should be sure to have a wing trimming lesson from an experienced trimmer, such as a veterinary professional, bird trainer, or breeder. like human hair and pet fur, bird feathers are shed and regrown regularly. birds lose their feathers in an orderly, sequential process, rather than all at once, so that in the wild, they are never rendered flightless and subject to predation. the feathers birds require for flight—so-called “flight feathers”—consist of the 10 outermost wing feathers, called primaries, and the 9 to 25 (depending on species) innermost wing feathers, called secondaries. all of these feathers are anchored in bone. as new feathers grow in, they initially contain blood in the shaft, looking like a drinking straw filled with blood, and are called blood feathers. blood recedes toward the feather base as the feather matures, so that the shaft eventually looks like an empty straw. there are nerves at the base of the feathers, near their attachment to bone, but there are no nerve endings along the feather shaft. if wing feathers are cut or damaged, the bird’s ability to fly is usually impaired. some bird owners and trainers choose to cut primary feathers to inhibit flight. while certain people are adamantly opposed to this process, there are times when it is appropriate; it depends on the specific bird in a specific situation. regardless, wing trimming is temporary, and as new feathers grow in to replace cut ones—just like hair growing back after a haircut—a bird’s ability to fly is regained. when done for the right reasons and in the correct manner, wing clipping can be painless, helpful, and safe; however, it is not right for every bird or every owner.",Why Do Birds Need Their Wings Clipped?,Why Do Birds Need Their Wings Clipped,Birds,308,370
"when to clip the wings many bird owners and trainers choose to clip their pets’ wings when they are training them to step-up on a hand or come out of their cages. in these instances, it is much harder to train a bird if it is sailing uncontrollably around a room. owners also may choose to trim their bird’s feathers if the bird is exposed to potential hazards, such as open windows and doors, mirrors, ceiling fans, heavy furniture or appliances behind which the bird could become easily trapped, lit fireplaces, candles, stoves, or exposed containers of hot liquids, such as in a kitchen or dining room. all of these situations are dangerous if a bird flies into them. other bird owners trim their pets’ wings so as not to have them fly around the house leaving messy droppings in their wake, or have them land on curtains, rugs, or furniture that they could chew up and destroy. , why do birds need their wings clipped? ideally, wing clipping is started when birds are young and aren’t used to flying; that way, birds don’t automatically try to take off during training and land on the floor. wing clipping may be performed in older birds as well, even if they are accustomed to flying, but it may be best to trim a feather or two at a time in these birds, so that wing trimming is done gradually and the birds have time to realize they can’t fly anymore.",When to Clip the Wings,Why Do Birds Need Their Wings Clipped,Birds,248,282
"when not to clip a bird's wings while wing clipping may be appropriate for some birds in specific situations, it is not right for every bird. for example, overweight birds that need to slim down often benefit from the exercise gotten from flying. in addition, birds living in households where there are other potentially predatory pets, such as cats and dogs, are generally safer when they can fly away, out of these animals’ reach. birds living in homes with small active children also may be better off being able to fly out of the way to avoid being trampled. finally, many birds truly enjoy the process of flying and the independence of being able to get from place to place, and as long as owners take safeguards, such as shutting windows and doors, covering mirrors, turning off ceiling fans, and ensuring there are no exposed flames, hot liquids, or predatory pets, it is fine for a bird to fly around while supervised.",When Not to Clip a Bird's Wings,Why Do Birds Need Their Wings Clipped,Birds,162,184
"how to clip a bird's wings there are many different methods of wing clipping. however, not all of them work equally well to prevent flight, and not all of them last the same amount of time to prevent flight. the goal of a proper wing trim is to trim enough feathers to prevent a bird from achieving lift as it takes off, but not to trim so much so that the bird drops like a rock to the ground. a bird with a proper wing trim should be able to glide safely to the floor without sailing around. to hinder flight, you must trim the primary feathers. some people choose to trim a varying number of the outermost ten primary feathers, but only the outermost five primary feathers need to be trimmed to prevent flight, in most cases. trimming more than that, or trimming the secondary feathers, is not necessary and can actually cause problems when the sharp cut end of the trimmed feather is close to the body and sticks into the bird’s side, causing skin irritation. many birds will pick at cut feathers if they are too close to their bodies, as the trimmed edges annoy them. cutting only the outermost five primary feathers makes it less likely that the cut ends will rub against the bird’s body and disturb them. some bird owners leave the outermost two primary feathers intact when they are trimming, as this type of clip leaves a more pleasing cosmetic appearance when the bird’s wings are folded, making it appear as if they are not clipped at all. i generally , why do birds need their wings clipped? do not recommend this type of clip, since all it takes is the regrowth of a single clipped primary feather in this case to allow the bird to fly again. many owners don’t realize that a feather has grown back, exposing the bird to potential danger without their owner’s knowledge. primary feathers should be cut below the level of the primary covert feathers (the shorter, smaller feathers visible overlying the primary feathers, close to their attachment to bone, on the inside of the extended wing). the lower third to half of the primary feather should be clipped off, but no more. trimming more than this length gets too close to the nerve endings of the feather at the base, near the bone, and may cause a bird discomfort. in addition, care must be taken never to cut a newly formed blood feather, as this could lead to severe, persistent bleeding that can be life threatening if it isn’t stopped.",How to Clip a Bird's Wings,Why Do Birds Need Their Wings Clipped,Birds,434,482
"what to do if a wing clip goes badly before attempting to clip a bird’s wings, an owner should be sure to have a wing trimming lesson from an experienced trimmer, such as a veterinary professional, bird trainer, or breeder. if too many primary feathers or any secondary feathers are trimmed, or if the primaries are trimmed too short, a bird may plummet to the ground if it attempts to fly. heavy-bodied birds, such as african gray parrots, amazon parrots, and cockatoos that attempt to fly with too short a wing trim may actually split open the skin and muscle on either side of the keel (breast) bone, causing significant injury. inappropriately trimmed feathers will grow back over time but may take months to regrow, and feathers that are trimmed excessively short may never grow back or may regrow in a deformed (twisted, bent) manner. if a blood feather is cut, excessive bleeding may occur that must be actively stopped by applying pressure to the cut end with a paper towel until clotting occurs—often not for several minutes. if a cut blood feather does not clot with the application of pressure, a small amount of flour, warm candle wax, or bar soap may be applied to the cut end to stop bleeding. commercially available styptic powder may also be applied; however, this material can be very caustic, injuring healthy feather tissue, and it can be toxic if the bird ingests it. therefore, styptic powder should be gently rinsed off with warm water after the clot has formed, without touching the feather to avoid disturbing the newly formed clot.",What to Do if a Wing Clip Goes Badly,Why Do Birds Need Their Wings Clipped,Birds,268,303
