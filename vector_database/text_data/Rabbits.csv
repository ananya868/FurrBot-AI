"epiphora in rabbits epiphora is characterized by an abnormal flow of tears from the eyes, usually occurring as a result of poor eyelid function, blockage of the nasal and eye portion of the tear ducts (nasolacrimal), or eye infection or inflammation, which may all be precipitated by by dental disease or tooth abscess. as rabbits have only one tear duct -- located very close to the tooth and gums -- the duct can be easily blocked due to oral disease (longtooth impaction is also very common in rabbits). epiphora may occur also due to longstanding respiratory disorders that block the nasal passages. congenital tooth malocclusion, and congenital eyelid deformities are usually seen in young rabbits. middle-aged rabbits, meanwhile, usually suffer from cheek tooth elongation and subsequent epiphora. and dwarf and lop breeds often show congenital tooth malocclusion, exposing them to blocked tear ducts. dwarf and himalayan breeds also often suffer from glaucoma; more rarely, glaucoma affects the rex and new zealand white breeds. symptoms and types rabbits suffering from epiphora will typically have a history of dental disease, incisor overgrowth, and upper respiratory infection. other common symptoms associated with epiphora include: lethargy depression hunched posture constant hiding or unwillingness to move inability to keep food in the mouth (i.e., constantly dropping food) loss of hair, crusts, and matted fur around the face red eyes, sometimes with thick discharge bulging eyeballs and facial masses (especially those with tooth root abscesses)",Epiphora in Rabbits Symptoms and Types,Abnormal Flow of Tears Due to Nasal Duct Blockage in Rabbits,Rabbits,239,273

"gastrointestinal (gi) stasis the term “hairball” has been used for decades to describe a syndrome in rabbits in which they stop eating, stop passing stool, and become bloated with gi tract gas, fecal material, and dry mats of hair. the assumption was that the “hairball” was the cause of the slowing down or complete cessation of food movement through the gi tract. however, this is not true. the hairball actually is a result of, rather than the cause of, the problem. rabbits normally have some hair in their gi tracts from grooming. with gi stasis, the problem is not an accumulation of hair in the stomach but instead decreased movement of food through the gi tract from a combination of decreased food intake, dehydration, and changes in the population of gi bacteria that normally ferment the food in a healthy rabbit’s gi tract. as a result, food and dehydrated mats of hair form an impaction, typically in the stomach. the appropriate term for this condition is gi stasis, and it can be a life-threatening problem in rabbits if they are not treated as soon as signs occur. gi stasis commonly develops when rabbits stop eating for a variety of reasons, including dental problems, respiratory tract infections, or even stress. regardless of the cause for their not eating, rabbits showing signs of gi stasis should be examined by a veterinarian immediately and treated with subcutaneous fluids (or intravenous fluids, if they are very dehydrated), gi motility-enhancing medications, anti-gas drugs, and syringe feeding. veterinarians should also diagnose and treat the primary cause of the rabbit’s decreased appetite. when treated early and aggressively, rabbits can make a full recovery even from severe gi stasis.",Gastrointestinal (GI) Stasis,Common Illnesses in Small Pets_ Rabbits,Rabbits,281,324
"dental disease teeth problems are also very common in rabbits and are often linked to improper diet. /24, rabbits’ teeth (both front incisors and back molars) are open-rooted and grow continuously, up to 4-5 inches a year. rabbits’ teeth will often overgrow when rabbits are eating excess amounts of soft, crumbly pellets and are not grinding their teeth down by chewing on enough coarse hay, as they would in the wild. once overgrown, molars may become abscessed at the roots or form sharp spurs/points on their surfaces from abnormal wear. the sharp edges can cut into the tongue, gums, and cheeks. when upper and lower teeth do not meet properly during chewing to wear down sufficiently, the rabbit is said to suffer from dental malocclusion. front teeth may overgrow to the point that they protrude out of the mouth, grow at an angle to each other, curl back into the mouth, curl sideways, or take on other problematic positions. rabbits with dental disease will often drool, stop eating, stop passing stool, and develop secondary gi stasis. rabbits with these signs should be examined right away by a veterinarian who can trim the teeth to try to re-establish normal occlusion of upper and lower teeth, as well as treat signs of gi stasis, if they are present. tooth root abscesses may require teeth extraction under anesthesia, plus administration of antibiotics and pain relievers. once they are eating again, rabbits with dental problems must be fed hay to try to prevent tooth re-overgrowth. unfortunately, many rabbits with dental problems suffer from them long-term and require repeated veterinary treatment.",Dental Disease,Common Illnesses in Small Pets_ Rabbits,Rabbits,266,307
"uterine tumors statistics show that as many as 70 percent of un-spayed female rabbits over 3-4 years of age develop uterine cancer. for this reason, all female rabbits should be spayed (have their uterus and ovaries removed) as soon as possible after 5-6 months of age. un-spayed female rabbits often initially develop benign changes in their uterine endometrium (lining) that progress to malignant cancer over time. after several months, uterine cancer can spread or metastasize from the uterus to other parts of the body, especially the lungs. once the cancer has spread, the condition is typically fatal. however, before it spreads, uterine cancer is completely curable if the rabbit is spayed. rabbits with uterine cancer may at first show no signs other than a decreased appetite. some may develop gi stasis. over time, they may have bloody urine. they may lose weight and appear to have swollen bellies from a distended uterus. rabbits with any of these signs should be examined by a veterinarian, who can often feel the rabbit’s enlarged uterus through her abdomen. a rabbit with a palpably enlarged uterus should have an x-ray of its abdomen and chest to ensure that no tumors are visible in the chest and to confirm that the uterus alone is being affected. sometimes an ultrasound of the belly is required to confirm /24, that the uterus is enlarged. if it is, and the chest looks clear, the rabbit should be spayed as soon as possible.",Uterine Tumors,Common Illnesses in Small Pets_ Rabbits,Rabbits,244,277
"head tilt tilting the head to one side — referred to as torticollis — is a common sign in rabbits that can have different causes. the two most common causes of torticollis in rabbits are inner ear infection with bacteria and brain infection with a parasite called encephalitozoon cuniculi (or e. cuniculi ). inner ear infection with bacteria is especially common in lop-eared rabbits whose ears point down and may, as a result, trap moisture and grow bacteria more easily in the ear canals. these rabbits may be eating and active and simply have a head tilt toward the infected ear, or they may be lethargic, not eating, have involuntary eye movements back and forth, and have vertigo to the point that they are rolling over and over on their sides in the direction of the head tilt. pus may or may not be visible in the ear canal when a veterinarian looks into it with a lighted scope. x-rays of the head showing pus inside the inner ear, which is actually inside the skull, as well as a moth-eaten appearance to the skull bones, may be necessary for a veterinarian to confirm that there is inner ear disease. treatment involves long-term administration of antibiotics and anti-inflammatory drugs, as well as supportive care, such as syringe feeding. e. cuniculi is a microscopic parasite that infects the brain and spinal cord (central nervous system, or cns), causing various abnormal neurologic signs including head tilt, circling or rolling to one side, seizures, repeated stretching of the limbs, and abnormal eye movements. some rabbits carry this parasite in their cns without showing any signs, and they spread it to other rabbits through their urine. e. cuniculi infection is impossible for a veterinarian to distinguish from inner ear infection without x-rays and blood tests. rabbits diagnosed with e. cuniculi are treated long-term with anti-parasitic and anti-inflammatory medications and supportive care, such as assisted feeding, as needed. head tilt often resolves in these rabbits, but for some, it persists, and they learn to adapt to the condition, despite the tilt.",Head Tilt,Common Illnesses in Small Pets_ Rabbits,Rabbits,345,395
"respiratory tract infections rabbits are obligatory nasal breathers, meaning they must breathe through their noses and cannot breathe well through their mouths. they commonly get respiratory tract infections that can affect both their upper airways (nose and trachea) and lower airways (lungs). /24, rabbits with infections confined to their upper airways often are referred to as having “snuffles.” rabbits with mucus and discharge blocking their nasal passages may sneeze repeatedly and have trouble breathing. “pneumonia” is reserved for those that have an infection affecting the lower airways as well as the upper. those with pneumonia may also have trouble breathing, and may wheeze and sneeze. rabbits with respiratory tract infections may have decreased appetites, eye discharge, decreased stool production, and weight loss. they may develop gi stasis secondary to respiratory tract infection. respiratory tract infections in rabbits are most commonly caused by bacteria — especially bacteria called pasteurella. pasteurella bacteria are often carried by rodents, such as guinea pigs; thus, rodents and rabbits should never be housed together. other types of bacteria, beside pasteurella, as well as certain viruses, and occasionally fungus, can cause respiratory tract infections in rabbits, too. rabbits with respiratory tract infections — especially those that are having trouble breathing — should be checked by a veterinarian as soon as possible. x-rays are often necessary to assess the rabbit’s lungs. severely affected rabbits may need to be given oxygen, antibiotics, and anti-inflammatory drugs, as well as fluids subcutaneously or intravenously, and syringe feeding. rabbits with blocked nasal passages may need their nostrils cleared so that they can breathe. left untreated, rabbits with respiratory infections can die. with long-term medical treatment and supportive care, however, even rabbits with pneumonia can make a full recovery. /24, ",Respiratory Tract Infections,Common Illnesses in Small Pets_ Rabbits,Rabbits,287,334

""easter may not be the best time to purchase a rabbit,"" says dean. ""do your research before getting a rabbit, and really talk to your family and make sure it's clear who is taking care of the rabbit ... because rabbits are not an appropriate pets for kids and they are high maintenance."" and what if your child asks you for a chick or a duckling instead of a rabbit? cute as they may be when they are babies, they will grow up. chickens and ducks are even harder to find homes for than rabbits, and to meet the demand during easter, hatcheries and farms often increase the normal output of chicks and ducklings, increasing the stress on the animals and making them more prone to disease. one such disease, salmonellosis, causes diarrhea, fever, and stomach pain in humans, especially in the elderly and young children. to many, springtime represents a renewal of life. be certain that you are not sacrificing the life of an innocent creature for a little easter joy this year. /24, easter is not a good time to get a pet bunny-rabbit ",Easter is Not a Good Time to Get a Pet Bunny-Rabbit,Easter is Not a Good Time to Get a Pet Bunny-Rabbit,Rabbits,693,804

"how to feed and groom a rabbit rabbits require a mix of the following items in order to maintain a healthy diet: hay : stimulates rabbits’ normal chewing behaviors and provides appropriate wear on their teeth, preventing dental disease. the fiber in hay will also encourage proper digestion. fresh grass hays (such as timothy, oat, coastal, brome, bahia or wheat hay) should be provided to the rabbit in unlimited amounts every day. “hay is the most important part of the diet; they can survive on this alone,” said dr. darryl heard, dvm and professor at the university of florida’s school of veterinary medicine. vegetables : leafy green vegetables are used to supplement the hay and provide additional vitamins and nutrients. the house rabbit society recommends feeding your rabbit a daily mix of three different vegetables like carrots, collard greens, beet greens, broccoli and romaine lettuce. /24, rabbit pellets : provide additional nutrients to a rabbit but should only be fed as an additional supplement to its diet. rabbit rescue and rehab advises against pellets that contain seeds, nuts or corn, as these are not required in a rabbit’s diet and can contribute to health problems. water : as mentioned, rabbits should have access to fresh, clean water at all times. sipper bottles can be used, heard said, but should be checked regularly to ensure they are working properly, as rabbits will chew on the ends and can cause them to jam. treats : every pet deserves a treat now and again, but be careful which ones you pick for your rabbit. too many simple sugars or starches can throw the balance of bacteria in their intestinal tracts off, causing illness. when it comes to keeping your rabbit clean, rabbits are prodigious self-groomers and don’t need a whole lot of help from us, cotter said. they’ll need to be brushed during their sheds and have their nails clipped every few months, but that’s is generally all that’s needed. be sure to talk to your veterinarian about any nail-trimming questions you have before you attempt clipping at home. rabbit rescue and rehab recommends changing your rabbit’s litter box daily and cleaning the crate once or twice a week by emptying it, sweeping it out and scrubbing the bottom with warm water.",How to Feed and Groom a Rabbit,How to Care for Your Rabbit,Rabbits,379,434

"when is it best to start leash training? while age doesn’t necessarily play a factor in how easily your rabbit takes to his leash, keep in mind that older rabbits may have pain from arthritis or other maladies, so that could inhibit his ability to be leash trained. “starting with very young rabbits will require changing the size of the harness as the rabbit grows,” says laroche. “but an adult rabbit with the right attitude can be trained just as easily as a youngster — sometimes even more easily since the adults have a longer attention span.” additionally, rabbits tend to be more receptive to food reinforcers in the morning and evening due to their crepuscular nature (active during twilight hours), says heidenreich. “if you intend to use food to train the behavior, those are good times to have a training session,” she said. “if your rabbit is receptive to touch as a reinforcer — many rabbits like their head and ears stroked —late afternoon is usually a nice time for such interactions.”",When is it best to start leash training?,How to Leash Train a Pet Rabbit,Rabbits,173,193

"how can i tell if my rabbit is actually being destructive? it’s often a matter of context when it comes to determining your rabbit’s behavior, says dr. krempels. “sometimes a rabbit will learn that a ‘normal’ behavior elicits a negative reaction — and remember, negative attention is still attention — from the caregiver, and so will use it to get attention,” she said. “another behavior many caregivers find objectionable is urine spraying, but in most cases this is just the rabbit’s way of saying, ‘i love you! you’re mine!’” however, she added, “it can also mean, depending on context, ‘you are the subordinate, and i anoint you with my majestic pee to prove my point.’” in other words, if your rabbit decides to exhibit his objectionable behaviors after a particularly rough time — perhaps you recently moved, have been trying to litter train your rabbit, got a new pet, or got married, and your partner is now around more — your rabbit could be performing these behaviors as an objection, or a way of lashing out. /24, ",How can I tell if my rabbit is actually being destructive?,How to Stop Rabbits from Chewing on Things,Rabbits,177,213

"lionhead rabbit | petmd petmd.com /rabbit/breeds/lionhead lionhead rabbits are the product of breeding a swiss fox rabbit with a netherland dwarf rabbit. the result was a genetic mutation known as “the mane gene,” which causes long, wooly fur to grow specifically around the rabbit’s head. aptly named for their thick manes, lionhead rabbits come in two varieties: single maned lionheads have a mane encircling the head when young, but it may be wispy and usually diminishes as they age. double maned lionheads keep their thick mane for life and can even have longer fur around their flanks and back legs. the difference between a single maned and double maned lionhead rabbit is noticeable at birth, as a double maned rabbit will have a distinctive “v” mark on their back. originally developed in france and belgium, lionhead rabbits came to the united states in the late 1990s. the american rabbit breeders association (arba) officially recognized the breed in 2013. as one of the smaller rabbit breeds, adult lionheads are 8–10 inches long and weigh between 2.5–3.75 pounds. they have relatively short ears (2–3.5 inches long), a compact upright body, and a high head mount. the typical lionhead rabbit lifespan is 7–9 years.",Lionhead Rabbit | PetMD,Lionhead Rabbit _ PetMD,Rabbits,201,236

"pododermatitis in rabbits petmd.com /rabbit/conditions/skin/pododermatitis-rabbits what is pododermatitis in rabbits? pododermatitis means inflammation of the feet. this is a fairly common condition in rabbits at any age or gender, so it is essential to know what signs to watch out for and what preventative measures you can take to prevent it. unlike cats, dogs, and humans, rabbits do not have a foot pad or thick musculature on their feet and hock/ankle bottoms. they have very thick fur over thin skin to protect and cushion the feet. if that fur is compromised or lost, without the thick cushion that the fur provides, excessive pressure on the underlying skin can become inflamed. without any intervention, continued pressure and friction can cause ulcers and infection, and it can cause a lack of blood flow to the area resulting in tissue death or necrosis. anything that causes excessive pressure, shearing forces, friction, and moisture can cause pressure sores in people and rabbits, especially on the bottoms of their feet. some rabbit breeds are more likely to get pododermatitis, like the short-coated rex breeds because the fur is already thin on their feet, or large giant breed rabbits because they have extra pressure and weight placed on their feet. rabbits that also love to thump or slap their back feet on the ground can be at risk for developing pododermatitis down the road due to this behavior. pododermatitis is commonly called ulcerative pododermatitis because it often causes tiny surface ulcers as part of the disease process. sore hocks is also a common term for the condition because it often causes inflammation of the rabbit's feet and hock or ankle. bumblefoot is commonly used in birds but can also be referred to in rabbits.",Pododermatitis in Rabbits What is Pododermatitis in Rabbits?,Pododermatitis in Rabbits,Rabbits,288,323

"signs of dental disease in rabbits pet rabbits commonly develop dental disease, and owners often are not aware of these problems until disease is advanced. with advanced conditions, owners may notice their pet dropping food from its mouth, increased salivation, selective appetite for soft foods or decreased appetite, overgrowth of incisors (front teeth) from lack of wear, or even discharge from the eyes due to compression of the tear ducts from overgrown tooth roots. early on, the only way to diagnose dental problems in rabbits is to have a knowledgeable veterinarian perform a thorough oral examination (often under sedation) and take x-rays of the skull to see the tooth roots below the gum line. an overgrowth of a rabbit’s incisors generally indicates that the upper and lower jaws do not meet squarely to wear the top and bottom teeth down when the animal chews – a condition called malocclusion. when a rabbit’s jaw isn’t aligned properly, owners may see their incisors get long and an oral examination will likely also show that the back teeth will be overgrown and may have sharp edges, making it uncomfortable for the rabbit to chew. /24, as the crowns of the teeth grow longer inside the mouth, the top and bottom teeth hit as the rabbit chews, putting pressure on tooth roots below the gum line and leading to loosening of the teeth and development of gaps between the teeth and gums. food and bacteria become entrapped in these gaps, leading to infection of teeth roots and formation of jaw abscesses that, when advanced, appear as hard, bony swellings along the outer jaw that can get as big as softballs. this is, unfortunately, when many owners notice a problem, as some rabbits with jaw abscesses may continue to eat well.",Signs of Dental Disease in Rabbits,Rabbit Dental Care 101,Rabbits,296,329

"the basics of bunny care the first thing any potential rabbit owner should keep in mind is that some people can be highly allergic to rabbits, developing runny eyes, nose, or even anaphylactic reactions, so it’s worth getting your whole family checked out before purchasing one. families with a history of pet allergies should consult their physicians about testing for allergies specifically to rabbits. since some people are more allergic to some types of rabbits than others, as long as your physician says it’s okay, it may be prudent to expose all potentially allergic family members to the specific rabbit being considered before taking it home. if you are getting a female rabbit, you will want to spay her at about six months of age, as over 70 percent of unspayed rabbits will likely develop uterine cancer after three years. “female rabbits should be spayed to prevent uterine cancer and to decrease aggression,” donnelly said. “male rabbits can be neutered to prevent breeding or territory marking/spraying. spay or neuter is especially important if you want to keep more than one rabbit in the same space.” when determining whether or not to get one rabbit or two, you’ll want to keep in mind that both male and female rabbits can be aggressive towards each other, and you should speak with your veterinarian before deciding to bring home a second rabbit, donnelly said. /24, with the proper care and attention to your rabbit’s diet and environment, most pet rabbits can live anywhere from eight to twelve years in captivity, can be litter-trained and are quite personable and social, donnelly said. in fact, many people allow their rabbits to roam freely in their house when they are home, she said. “of course, it’s important to supervise this activity, as chewing on baseboards and paint chips can lead to health issues ranging from gastrointestinal upset to lead poisoning.” other things to consider include: diet: food for pet rabbits should consist primarily of grass-based hays and a small amount (about two tablespoons per day) of rabbit pellets. “fresh greens are an important supplement to a rabbit’s diet and should include leafy greens such as romaine, green leaf and red leaf lettuces,” donnelly said. limit the darker greens like kale, collards or spinach, as these contain too much calcium and oxylates and may contribute to bladder stone formation. also, avoid feeding excessive amounts of fruits and other sugar-containing foods, as those may contribute to dental disease and gastrointestinal disorders, donnelly added. cage: whether it’s home-built bunny condos, large crates or specialized rabbit cages, the size of your rabbit’s habitat should be determined by its size. bigger is better (it should be least six-times the length of your stretched-out bunny), as you’ll want to make sure that your furry friend has room to run around, play and hide. make sure your rabbit’s cage has solid or slatted plastic floors, and avoid wire-bottomed ones that cause ulcers to form on the bottom of their feet. your rabbit will also require a water bottle or heavy bowl (rabbits are known for over- turning lighter bowls), a plastic litter box and a play house where he can hide out when he’s feeling particularly tired or shy. toys: most rabbits enjoy spending time with their people, so supervised playtime with your rabbit outside of its cage is recommended as often as possible. rabbits love playing with almost any kind of toy, but should be given rabbit toys that are safe to hide in or chew on (like empty paper towel and toilet paper rolls). rabbits can also play with hard, plastic cat toys that can’t easily be ingested and that can be rolled or tossed at them, or other toys that can be hung from their cage for reaching or swatting. handling: remember that rabbits can be skittish (especially if they are small), so you’ll need to handle your rabbit with care. some rabbits don’t like to be held at all and would much prefer their freedom to roam around on their own, although a gentle pat or scratch from time-to-time is usually welcome. if you do pick up your bunny, be sure to hold it close to your body and support its hind end well, as rabbits like to kick and can easily break their backs if their back ends are not supported. /24, grooming: your rabbit shouldn’t need baths like other animals (in fact, baths should actually be avoided for the stress they may cause) as they are naturally very clean. they will need their nails trimmed at least every six weeks, however, and their coats should be brushed at least once a week (or more if he has long fur or is shedding a lot). before attempting to trim your rabbit’s nails on your own, consult with your vet first for the proper technique, since nail trimming requires restraining your bunny and using special nail clippers, which could lead to bleeding if your rabbit’s nails are cut too close to the quick. /24, ",The Basics of Bunny Care,The Complete Guide to Rabbits,Rabbits,835,957

"causes there are many different reasons an abscess forms under a tooth or near a tooth's root. for example, an infection can occur in cases of tooth or dental decay. however, rabbit abscesses are unlike those that form in other animals, like cats and dogs. they do not rupture on their own and drain infrequently. rather, they tend to puncture the bone of the rabbit, often requiring surgical treatment. the most common cause of tooth root abscesses in rabbits is tooth elongation. this is a chronic and common condition because rabbit teeth tend to grow constantly -- at the rate of nearly one-half an inch every month. the cheek teeth can then become spiked and erode, or gradually wear into the soft tissue near the teeth, allowing abscess-causing bacteria to enter into the gums. tissue damage can also lead to the formation of an abscess. other causes and factors contributing to tooth root abscesses include: infection with pyogenic bacteria (e.g., streptococcus spp., fusobacterium nucleatum, prevotella spp. and peptostreptococcus micros) /24, trauma to the teeth or roots, including clipping of the teeth or cutting the pulp when trimming teeth, which can expose them to bacteria acquired teeth elongation, which can occur from an exclusive pellet diet suppression of the immune system, which can occur from the overuse of topical or oral steroids",Causes,Tooth Root Abscess in Rabbits,Rabbits,221,255

"what do you feed a rabbit? petmd.com /rabbit/nutrition/evr_rb_what-do-you-feed-a-rabbit by helen-anne travis what do you feed a rabbit? the answer is simple. rabbits thrive on high-fiber diets rich in grass hays including timothy, brome and orchardgrass hay. those new to rabbit ownership may think the big bags of pellets for sale at the local pet store are all a rabbit should eat. instead, the pellets are more like a rabbit multivitamin, providing supplemental minerals, protein and fiber. “pellets are far too rich to make up the bulk of [a rabbit’s] diet,” said dr. peter helmer, a specialist in small mammals at bluepearl veterinary partners in clearwater, fl. “rabbits have evolved eating grasses and roots; there are no pellet dispensers in the wild.” you can also feed your pet rabbit fresh vegetables, but not the carrots we associate with bugs bunny. carrots have more sugar than adult rabbits’ digestive tracts prefer. small amounts are fine as treats, helmer said, but dark leafy greens are preferred. broccoli leaves and stems and dark leaf lettuces make more suitable rabbit snacks.",What Do You Feed a Rabbit?,What Do You Feed a Rabbit_,Rabbits,176,215
"what to feed a baby rabbit versus an adult rabbit for the first seven weeks of life, a baby rabbit’s diet should consist of mostly its mother’s milk, according to the house rabbit society, a nonprofit organization dedicated to rescuing abandoned rabbits and educating the public on rabbit care. at three weeks, alfalfa hay and pellets can be slowly introduced, giving them free range to both at seven weeks. during this period you can also give your pet small tastes of romaine lettuce and carrots, but should avoid the dark leafy greens until your rabbit is a bit older. while baby rabbits (which are called kits) thrive on the protein and calcium-rich alfalfa hays, adult rabbits need something a bit more substantial. “it’s like feeding a dog puppy food,” helmer said. alfalfa hay is higher in calcium and protein than grass hay, which is ideal for growing rabbits but too rich for adults. if you are feeding alfalfa it's a good idea to feed it mixed with grass hay. this stops your rabbits getting so hooked on alfalfa that it's difficult to make the transition to grass hay when they reach adulthood. you should phase out alfalfa at around four to five months old. around six months, slowly start swapping out alfalfa in favor of grass hays and ease up on the pellets. adult rabbits should eat around cup of pellets per day for every five pounds of weight they have, according to helmer. /24, what do you feed a rabbit? by the end of its first year, your rabbit’s daily diet should consist of unlimited grass hays, a small portion of pellets and two to four cups of at least three different fresh vegetables for every six pounds of weight. wash and chop all vegetables thoroughly and serve them moist to help aid digestion. always introduce new foods slowly, and remember to keep your rabbit’s water dish clean and filled with fresh water.",What to Feed a Baby Rabbit Versus an Adult Rabbit,What Do You Feed a Rabbit_,Rabbits,324,364

"why is my rabbit so fat? controlling your small animal’s weight petmd.com /rabbit/general-health/why-my-rabbit-so-fat-controlling-your-small-animals-weight by laurie hess, dvm, dipl abvp (avian practice) just like people, dogs, and cats, pet rabbits can get fat. we all love to eat, and so do they. unlike their wild counterparts, however, pet rabbits don’t get the exercise they need to be able to munch away all day. plus, they don’t have to seek out food the way wild bunnies do, so pet rabbits tend not only to hop less but also to gain more. recognizing that a rabbit is fat can be difficult, as female rabbits normally have a fold of skin – the dewlap – under their chins to store fat. in an overweight rabbit, it may be difficult to feel the spine under layers of fat along the back. fat rabbits may also have extra folds of skin around their genital region, trapping urine and fecal pellets and leading to dermatitis (skin infection or inflammation) and matted fur from the accumulation of moisture and bacteria between skin folds that they are unable to reach back to groom. small animals that are overweight can develop many of the same problems that overweight people can, including arthritis and joint problems (which is especially common in guinea pigs), as well as sores or ulcers on the bottom of their feet from carrying around all those extra pounds. overweight rabbits may also have trouble turning around to reach their hind ends to ingest their first morning stool – the cecotrophs – that contain essential nutrients and that are typically softer than normal fecal pellets. added weight can also be taxing on a bunny’s heart, as it has to work extra hard to pump blood out to a larger than normal body. it’s better for pet rabbits to eat right to prevent obesity rather than to try to put them on a weight loss plan once they have become accustomed to eating in a certain way. so, how can you help your rabbit (or other small, herbivorous mammal, such as a guinea pig or chinchilla) stay lean and healthy? here are five tips to proper weight management in these species:",Why is My Rabbit So Fat?

"it’s all about the hay the staple of the diet for an adult rabbit, guinea pig or chinchilla should be hay. hay is important not only to maintain a healthy population of bacteria in their gastrointestinal (gi) tracts to ferment and digest the food they eat, but also to wear down their continuously growing teeth. wild rabbits chew on rough, fibrous grasses all day to keep their teeth in shape and their gi tracts happy. while we can’t replicate this diet exactly for our small and furry pets, hay provides the fiber pet rabbits need to keep them healthy, too. /24, ",It’s All About the Hay,Why is My Rabbit So Fat_ Controlling Your Small Animal’s Weight,Rabbits,101,114
"portion the pellets pellets are predominantly carbohydrate, and who doesn’t love to eat carbs? the same is true for pet rabbits and too many carbohydrates can pack on the pounds and upset the ph of the rabbit’s gi tract, throwing off the normal balance of their intestinal bacteria and leading to gas production, discomfort and often, ultimately, to decreased appetite. rabbits eating large amounts of crumbly pellets rather than fibrous hay also tend not to wear down the surfaces of their teeth properly, resulting in overgrowth and formation of sharp spurs on their continuously growing teeth that eventually cause pain on chewing, decreased appetite, a slow down of food passage through the gi tract and the development of a life-threatening condition commonly seen in rabbits called gi stasis. typically, rabbits with gi stasis must be treated with gi motility-enhancing drugs, fluids and syringe feeding to recover. if left untreated, rabbits with gi stasis can die. the rule of thumb for healthy pet rabbits is no more than a quarter of a cup of high fiber pellets per four to five pounds of bunny per day. if your rabbit weighs more than this, than he or she can get a little more, and if he or she is less than four pounds, he or she needs less. limiting pellets can be hard, as most rabbits chose them over other foods. but in the end, your rabbit will be healthier and feel better if you cut the carbs.",Portion the Pellets,Why is My Rabbit So Fat_ Controlling Your Small Animal’s Weight,Rabbits,246,275
"go for the greens like hay, greens promote chewing and contain fiber. they are also low in calorie, so rabbits can generally munch on greens to their hearts’ content without gaining weight. greens also have the added benefit of containing water – something herbivores need lots of for proper digestion. fresh leafy greens keep bunnies and other small mammals hydrated and promote the normal movement of food through their gi tracts. rabbits also have a tendency to absorb huge amounts of calcium from their food, which can settle out in the bladder like sand and can stick together to form bladder stones requiring surgery to remove. the water in greens helps flush out the bladder and lessens the likelihood of calcium forming this sediment in the bladder. two words of caution about greens, however. first, like some people, some rabbits can’t tolerate huge amounts of greens without developing diarrhea. every rabbit is different in terms of how much water he or she can ingest without having loose stool. second, while the water content of most greens actually helps keep calcium-based bladder sediment down, some greens – such as parsley, kale, and spinach – actually contain large amounts of calcium and should be fed just a few times per week. /24, ",Go for the Greens,Why is My Rabbit So Fat_ Controlling Your Small Animal’s Weight,Rabbits,210,234

"hop to it eating right is the key to weight loss in rabbits, guinea pigs and chinchillas, however, without exercise, it’s hard to maintain a proper weight. many pet bunnies spend most of their days in small cages with little room or opportunity to exercise. to promote a healthy body weight, small mammals should have several hours of out-of-cage time daily and should be encouraged to move around. providing your pet with a solid, non-slip surface to move around on and placing food bowls around the room force the rabbit (or other small mammal) to move around to eat and to burn calories on the way. having small mammals hunt or forage for bits of food hidden under pieces of paper or buried in chewable cardboard boxes is another way to promote exercise while providing mental stimulation, as well. lean, well-muscled rabbits will likely live longer and feel better than their overweight counterparts, and following these proper weight-management tips can help your pet be well on its way to healthier living. /24, ",Hop to It,Why is My Rabbit So Fat_ Controlling Your Small Animal’s Weight,Rabbits,172,195

"rabbits have strict dietary needs caring for bunnies as pets means paying particular attention to their diet. feeding the wrong type of hays in the wrong amounts at the wrong ages can cause major digestion issues and can even be fatal for rabbits. it can lead to gi stasis, which is a common and concerning issue in rabbits. “rabbits are strict vegetarians,” says dr. horton. “their main diet is grass hay, specifically timothy or orchard. as young rabbits, alfalfa is also part of their diet. rabbit pellets can be fed while growing or nursing but otherwise are allowed as treats or for training.” she adds that salad greens also play a big part in a balanced diet for rabbits. dr. horton says, “an adult rabbit may take 4-6 cups of healthy salad daily.” ignoring your rabbit’s dietary needs can lead to dangerous health problems. for example, obesity is common with rabbits who are fed pellets exclusively or are offered seed treats, says dr. horton. diarrhea can also occur with overindulgence in fruit. in fact, “improper gastrointestinal tract function or health is common in rabbits fed improperly,” dr. horton adds. “this can lead to serious consequences, or even death, if not attended to immediately.” /24, stick to a strict herbivore diet of unlimited timothy or orchard hay, small amounts of high-quality pellets and a daily ration of mixed greens, including dark green lettuces, kale, parsley, cilantro, mint, dill, basil and fennel, for optimal health, suggests dr. krempels.",Rabbits Have Strict Dietary Needs,Why Not to Give a Rabbit for an Easter Gift,Rabbits,246,296

"rabbits have unique grooming needs rabbits—especially long-haired ones—need to be brushed, since their fur can easily become matted. but, you should never give your rabbit a bath. “this can be so stressful to the rabbit that it may suffer cardiac arrest,” says dr. horton. it is important to clean your rabbit’s ears, however, especially if he’s lop-eared. “to clean a rabbit’s ears, use a cleaning solution prescribed by your veterinarian that is safe for rabbits,” says dr. horton. this solution should always be room temperature or a little warmer. instill enough fluid into the ear to fill the canal, and then gently massage the ear to loosen debris. “allow your rabbit to shake the liquid out of the ear,” dr. horton says. “swab what remains with a cotton ball.” cotton swabs should never be used, as these can cause damage to the ear canal or eardrum if used incorrectly. for more intense cleaning needs, see your veterinarian.",Rabbits Have Unique Grooming Needs,Why Not to Give a Rabbit for an Easter Gift,Rabbits,157,193

"rabbits require veterinary care, just like a dog or cat while rabbits do require at least yearly veterinary care, most veterinarians don’t see rabbits. you’ll need to find an exotic or small animal veterinarian to treat your pet rabbit. “veterinarians who examine rabbits go through special training and mentorship in order to properly care for this species,” says dr. horton. “not every veterinarian is trained for rabbits, so research to find an appropriate veterinarian should occur beforehand.” it’s also extremely important to get your rabbit spayed or neutered, just as you would a dog. “female rabbits have a very high incidence of uterine cancer if not spayed,” says dr. krempels. with so much to keep in mind when it comes to caring for bunnies as pets, it’s never a good idea to get one as a surprise gift. “the truth is that no pet should be given as a gift to someone who isn’t prepared,” says dr. horton. “respecting the animal you have chosen to live with is part of pet ownership.” you need to be prepared for the responsibility of the care and well-being of that pet for their entire life. by: cheryl lock featured image: istock.com/fatcamera /24, ","Rabbits Require Veterinary Care, Just Like a Dog or Cat",Why Not to Give a Rabbit for an Easter Gift,Rabbits,199,236
