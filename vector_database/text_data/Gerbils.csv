"salmonellosis in gerbils salmonellosis is a contagious disease caused by infection with the salmonella bacterium. it is quite rare in pet gerbils and is usually spreads due to the ingestion of food or water that has been contaminated with the infected feces or urine of wild rodents. infected bedding material can also act as a potential source for transmission of salmonellosis disease in gerbils. an infected gerbil that is being treated for salmonellosis may still continue to infect other animals even thought it does not appear to be sick. it is important to note that this disease has known zoonotic potential, and an infected gerbil can act as a source for the spread of salmonellosis to humans as well. hence, salmonellosis needs to be managed with caution. treatment is generally not effective for the control of salmonellosis. taking steps to prevent the spread of this bacterial infection is the best way to manage salmonellosis in gerbils. finally, infected gerbils can act as potential sources for the spread of salmonellosis infection to each other, and to humans as well, making this a disease with zoonotic potential. hence this condition should be managed with caution, with disposable medical grade gloves used for cleaning and handling all things gerbil related (including the gerbil itself), sanitizing or disposing of all gerbil equipment and bedding, and care taken when going from the gerbil to other gerbils, people, or even to other animals. symptoms and types salmonellosis is often fatal for gerbils. the symptoms which may be observed prior to it becoming severe include: depression dehydration rough hair coat distended abdomen diarrhea and resulting weight loss miscarriage (in pregnant gerbils)",Salmonellosis in Gerbils Symptoms and Types,Gerbils_Contagious Bacterial Disease Due to Salmonella in Gerbils,Gerbils,274,298

"choosing the right enclosure despite their small size, gerbils are active animals that need a spacious habit to run, climb, and explore comfortably. ideally, gerbils should be housed in a glass tank secured with an escape-proof mesh lid to allow for proper air circulation. the enclosure should be at least 20 gallons for a pair of gerbils. always provide the largest habitat possible. wire enclosures, though well-ventilated, are not recommended. gerbils are natural burrowers, and the wire used to make these habitats can injure gerbils' teeth and noses as they try to dig through the bottom. if a wire enclosure must be used, the spaces between the habitat’s bars should be around -in apart or smaller to prevent the gerbil from escaping or getting stuck. plastic habitats should be avoided, as gerbils can chew through them. recommended products : glass enclosures tetra glass aquarium, 29-gal (must be paired with a screened lid, such as the exo terra aquarium & terrarium screen

your habitat gerbils are comfortable in average household temperatures, and don’t thrive at temperatures greater than 80°f. gerbils are sensitive to extreme temperature changes, so habitats should be kept in a draft-free area that’s not close to an air conditioner or in direct sunlight. make sure the habitat is kept off the floor and is not accessible to other animals, like curious cats and dogs. due to their sociable nature, gerbils can become depressed when kept alone. since gerbils can become territorial as they mature, it’s best to adopt gerbils in same-sex pairs from the same litter when they’re around 5 to 6 weeks old. gerbils kept together in the same habitat should be watched for aggressive behavior. if the two gerbils fight, they should separated. pet parents should never keep different species of animals in the same habitat. bedding pet parents should offer two types of bedding in their gerbil's habitat: an absorbent substrate to line the bottom of the enclosure, and a fluffy nesting material they can use to make a cozy burrow. add 1–2 inches of high-quality, paper-based bedding or crumpled paper to the bottom of the habitat. paper-based bedding should be used instead of wood shavings or chips of any kind. unlike wood, paper is low-dust and digestible, meaning it won’t obstruct a gerbil’s gastrointestinal tract if ingested. avoid cedar-based and pine bedding products. these products have aromatic oils that can irritate gerbils’ skin and sensitive respiratory tracts. recommended products : frisco small animal bedding, natural oxbow pure comfort

bamboo nesting sweet meadow farm comfy cotton small pet nesting material décor & accessories hideout box : pet parents should provide each gerbil with at least one hideout box for privacy. if you have multiple gerbils in a habitat, each gerbil should have their own hideout. ideally, hideout boxes should be made from chewable materials, like hay or wood. plastic hideouts are durable and easier to disinfect, but they should be removed from the gerbil’s enclosure if the animal begins to chew on them. the broken plastic pieces can obstruct a gerbil’s gastrointestinal tract if ingested and cause serious injuries. recommended products : kaytee tropical fiddle sticks small animal flexible hideout oxbow timothy club bungalow small animal hideout ware wood den small animal hideout running wheel :

"causes of c. piliforme is a sporulating bacterium, which means the bacteria is enclosed in a protective casing. these types of sporulating bacteria can lie dormant for years, and gerbils can carry c. piliforme without showing signs of illness. it is transmitted to other gerbils by ingesting infected feces. gerbils that are young, stressed, or pregnant are more susceptible to infection. tyzzer's disease can be passed to other animals as well as people, although such occurrences are rare. the origin of this bacteria is unknown, but has been found worldwide. as a sporulating bacteria, c. piliforme can survive at room temperature for over a year. tyzzer's disease is extremely contagious from one gerbil to another . infection occurs when a gerbil ingests contaminated fecal matter, such as while eating food or grooming other gerbils. it is highly recommended to isolate any new gerbils for a minimum of one week to thirty days to observe for signs of illness before introducing to other gerbils. overcrowding and unsanitary conditions (such as dirty bedding or food dishes) can lead to sporadic outbreaks.",Causes of Tyzzer's Disease in Gerbils,Gerbils_Tyzzers Disease in Gerbils,Gerbils,179,203
