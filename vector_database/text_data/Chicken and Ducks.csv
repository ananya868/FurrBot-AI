"things to consider before adopting pet ducks ducks are high-maintenance pets. there’s a lot of cleanup needed, and it’s often a wet and stinky job. for example: ducks need lots of fresh water, and they soil it frequently. so you’ll spend a lot of time refreshing their water. pet ducks usually are unable to fly, so they are a big target for local wildlife predators like coyotes, birds of prey, and even stray cats. this means you have to provide hawk covers, which should be placed over their pens. when outside, your pet ducks will also need to be supervised and protected from potential animal attacks. ducks also don't do well in colder climates. if temperatures drop below 20 degrees fahrenheit, ducks are prone to frostbite on their feet. if you live in an area where it gets colder during winter, it’s important to offer treats that are high in fat and calories. treats such as cracked corn, warm oatmeal, and peanuts may help provide additional warmth overnight as the food digests. you should also provide additional warmth in their environment, such as a layer of straw to place on the coop floor. wooden plants, benches, or stumps are also helpful in keeping ducks off the ground. be sure to insulate your duck house with bales of hay along the inner walls—this will limit how much cold air comes through and allows them to stay warm in their duck house pet ducks can also be noisy, especially when they want something. neighbors may not appreciate the enthusiastic quacks as much as you do.",Things To Consider Before Adopting Pet Ducks,Are Ducks Good Pets_ What To Know About Pet Ducks,Chicken and Ducks,263,301

"choosing the right enclosure for the first six weeks of life, chicks should be housed in a draft-free, heated pen called a brooder. brooders must be well-ventilated and escape-proof, with walls at least 2 feet high. newly hatched chicks need a minimum of ½ square feet of brooder space each for the first few weeks of life, while chicks older than four weeks should have at least ¾ square feet of brooder space. ideally, pet parents should use a commercially available brooding kit to house their chicks. however, other enclosures, including large plastic storage bins, can be used if the habitat has suitable heat and ventilation. chicks can pack into tight corners and easily suffocate, so it’s best to use a brooder with a rounded or octagonal shape. pet parents can also use cardboard to block off square corners and discourage huddling. after about six weeks, once the chicks have feathered out and grown, they can be transferred to a chicken coop for the rest of their life. for help with selecting the perfect chicken coop, see our care sheet on chickens. setting up your habitat brooders should be kept in a draft-free area that can be kept warm, such as a heated garage, basement, or spare room. ensure the brooder is not accessible to unsupervised children or animals, like curious cats and dogs.",Choosing the Right Enclosure Setting Up Your Habitat,Baby Chicks Care Sheet,Chicken and Ducks,224,256
"temperature since newly hatched chicks cannot regulate their body temperature on their own, it’s important to keep a close eye on their brooder’s temperature until the chicks can be moved into a chicken coop. during the first week of life, chicks should be housed at temperatures from 93 to 95 f. each week thereafter, pet parents should reduce the brooder’s temperature by 5 f per week until the brooder reaches room temperature, no lower than 65–70 f before six weeks of age. /24, at comfortable temperatures, chicks should be able to roam and explore all around the brooder. if the chicks huddle together, it may be too cold. similarly, if the chicks seem to be avoiding their brooder’s heat source, it may be too hot. pet parents should use a thermometer to check the temperature of their chicks’ brooder several times a day to ensure it stays in the ideal range.",Temperature,Baby Chicks Care Sheet,Chicken and Ducks,151,173
"heating pet parents often use heat plates to warm their chicks’ brooder. as the chicks mature, the height of the heating plate needs to be adjusted to accommodate their growth. if heat plates are used, a 15-watt red light should be left on at night in the room where the brooder is kept so the chicks can see their surroundings and find the heat plate in the dark. instead of a heating plate, pet parents can install a heat lamp above their chicks’ brooder with a target temperature of 90–100 f for the chicks’ first week of life. heat lamps should be placed 20 inches above the brooder when the chicks are one week old, then moved 3 inches further from the brooder each week to decrease the enclosure’s temperature by 5 degrees until the brooder’s temperature is 65–70 f. a thermostat should be attached to heaters to keep the habitat’s temperature within a safe range and prevent the chicks from getting burned. replace lights after six months of use. pet parents can also shine an artificial led light on their chicks’ brooder to promote healthy egg production in adulthood. they should start with eight hours of light exposure each day and then increase the time by 30 minutes each week, until they reach 14–16 daily hours of light exposure.",Heating,Baby Chicks Care Sheet,Chicken and Ducks,220,245
"bedding pet parents should cover the bottom of their chicks’ brooder with at least 3–4 inches of absorbent bedding. commercially available paper litter, pine shavings, and aspen shavings are all suitable bedding materials. cedar-based products should be avoided because they have aromatic oils that can irritate chicks’ sensitive respiratory systems and put them at greater risk for infection. to teach newly hatched chicks the difference between bedding and food, pet parents can cover the bedding in their chicks’ brooder with a few layers of newspaper and sprinkle chick feed on it. then, they should remove one layer of newspaper daily for up to three days, until the chicks can find their feeder. newspaper should not be used beyond day one for heavier breeds like plymouth rock or wyandotte chicks, as they may slip or develop leg problems. /24, ",Bedding,Baby Chicks Care Sheet,Chicken and Ducks,138,156
"décor & accessories toys : adding appropriately sized toys to a brooder can enrich chicks’ environment, provide mental stimulation, and encourage physical activity. dangling toys with mirrors, ladders, and platforms designed for smaller birds (like parakeets) are all excellent choices for a flock of chicks. studies show that chicks raised with toys may have stronger immune systems, lower aggression/stress levels, and higher-quality egg production compared to those reared without them. feeder and waterer : pet parents should offer fresh food and water in an appropriately sized feeder and waterer designed for chicks. water bowls should not be used , as chicks can tip them over or fall into them and drown. water bowls are also prone to contamination from soiled bedding, droppings, and parasites. feeders and waterers should be elevated a few inches off the group to prevent droppings from contaminating them. these dishes should also be washed and rinsed thoroughly each day to prevent bacterial growth. as chicks mature and grow, more feeders should be added to their enclosure to discourage competition. each chick should have at least 2.5–3 inches of space at their feeder. roosting perch : chicks can begin to perch and roost at three weeks old. adding a roosting perch to a chicks’ brooder will help them sleep comfortably. each chick should have about 4 inches of space on a perch, which should be low to the ground to prevent injury if the chicks fall off. if heated perches are used in cold weather, they should be checked regularly to ensure they don’t get too hot and burn chicks’ feet.",Décor & Accessories,Baby Chicks Care Sheet,Chicken and Ducks,264,298

"baby chick diet and nutrition growing chicks should be fed a commercial starter feed designed for chicks, while fresh vegetables, fruits, and treats can be offered sparingly as treats. chicks need to be fed daily and should always have access to fresh, clean water. a nutritious and well-balanced diet for a chick includes a commercially available starter feed (crumbles or mash). starter feed is fortified with extra protein, fat, and vitamins to encourage healthy growth. pet parents should select a feed based on their chicken’s life stage and the manufacturer's recommendations. as a rule of thumb, chicks will only need a starter feed for the first four to eight weeks of their life. the chick then needs to be transitioned to a grower feed formulated for adolescent chickens. insoluble, fine-particle grit made specifically for chicks is a supplement designed to help chicks break down food and prevent gastrointestinal obstruction. pet parents should offer their chicks small amounts of insoluble grit as soon as they begin eating foods other than starter feed. chicks will need about 1–2 tablespoons of insoluble grit mixed into every quart of starter feed. vegetables, fruits, and treats may be offered in limited quantities (no more than 5% of a chick’s daily diet). chicks can safely enjoy a variety of fresh fruits and vegetables, including: corn /24, cucumber tomatoes leafy greens squash pumpkins strawberries fruits and vegetables should be sliced into tiny pieces before being offered to a chick. mealworms, waxworms, and “scratch” (mixed grains like barley, wheat, oats, and seeds) can all be offered as occasional treats as well. fresh, clean water should be changed daily and offered in a waterer that’s specifically designed for chicks. do not use a bowl to offer chicks water, as they can fall in and drown. pet parents can familiarize chicks with their waterer by gently dipping their beaks into the water on their first day home. do not allow chickens to ingest avocados, fruit seeds, chocolate, caffeine, alcohol, or very salty foods, as they are all toxic and can cause serious illness or death. pet parents should discard any uneaten fruits and vegetables after 10 hours, as they may spoil and cause infection if eaten.",Baby Chick Diet and Nutrition,Baby Chicks Care Sheet,Chicken and Ducks,366,423
"chick grooming and care pet parents should check on their chicks several times a day to make sure that their brooder is at a suitable temperature, that their waterer and feeders aren’t clogged, and that all chicks are happy and active. after about four weeks of age, pet parents can let their chicks spend warm days outside on clean, unfertilized grass. chicks must always be closely supervised and protected from predators while outside. bathing : chicks do not need to be bathed in the traditional sense. however, pet parents can encourage their chicks to take dust baths by adding a small, shallow container of clean sand, peat moss, or diatomaceous earth to their chicks’ brooder. dust baths remove dirt and oil buildup and can kill small pests that might be trapped in a chick’s feathers. a dust bath should not be left in a chicken coop for more than 12 hours at a time. /24, ",Chick Grooming and Care,Baby Chicks Care Sheet,Chicken and Ducks,155,174

"chickens have specific housing requirements chickens are appealing as pets to some people because many chicken coops are designed to look like decorative houses that are attractive additions to the yard. however, chickens have very particular housing needs, and some of these designer coops are not constructed to meet these needs. chickens need sunlight for example, not all chicken coops are heated, yet chickens housed outdoors in cold climates need heat when it’s very cold so that they don’t get frostbitten. similarly, chickens that are housed inside continuously over cold winters lack exposure to the sun’s ultraviolet (uv) rays, which are critical to helping them make vitamin d in their skin. vitamin d enables chickens to absorb calcium from their food so that they can make hard-shelled eggs. without adequate uv light exposure, chickens often lay soft or shell-less eggs or have eggs get stuck inside of them when they try to lay—a life- threatening condition called egg-binding. this happens because their uterine muscles run out of the calcium needed to push the eggs out. consequently, chickens living indoors in cold climates must have uv light bulbs built into their coops so that they don’t lay abnormal eggs or become egg-bound. chickens need nesting boxes in addition, chickens will only lay eggs if they are provided with boxes in which they can nest. coops should have one box for every four to five chickens for optimal egg- laying. nest boxes ideally should be placed in the least-trafficked part of the coop to prevent disturbing hens while they are laying, and they should be elevated 1-3 feet off the floor to prevent predators from jumping in them and debris from the coop floor collecting in them. nest boxes should be lined with bedding (pine shavings or straw hay) to keep chickens comfortable and to protect eggs once they are laid, and the boxes should be cleaned out regularly. coops should be spot-cleaned daily and fully swept out weekly, and they should be placed outside in areas where the top layer of soil can be /24, raked up and removed at least once a year. this prevents chickens from ingesting parasite eggs that are passed into the soil in their droppings and re-ingested, thereby perpetuating the parasite infection cycle. chickens need a fenced-in area to roam in addition to a coop, chickens need a safe, fenced-in area outside to roam and exercise in when there’s good weather. fences must extend both high above and deep below ground to prevent predators from jumping over and digging under them to get inside. chickens must also be provided with mental stimulation and environmental enrichment so that they don’t feather-pick or bully each other. enrichment may be offered in the form of perches of different heights, tunnels made from cardboard boxes, compost piles to dig in, and hanging vegetables, like heads of cabbage or lettuce, that they can peck. other favorites for chickens include toys such as mirrors and rope swings, bins filled with sand to bathe in, and insects such as mealworms to snack on.",Chickens Have Specific Housing Requirements,What You Should Know Before Getting Backyard Chickens,Chicken and Ducks,510,574
