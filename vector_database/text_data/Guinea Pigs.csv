"regular nail trims trimming nails is an important part of guinea pig care, but how often you need to do it depends on many factors. as a general rule, active guinea pigs with plenty of toys will trim their own nails just by moving around, so you might not need to do it as often. even active guinea pigs, however, might need a once-a-month trim to keep nails at a healthy and safe length, according to integrative veterinarian dr. carol osborne, dvm, owner of chagrin falls veterinary center & pet clinic. ask your veterinarian to show you how to cut guinea pig nails safely before you try for the first time. just like dogs and cats, if you cut too close, the quick will bleed and cause pain. if you're not comfortable trimming your guinea pig’s nails, then just call your vet and see if they might be able to help you out, dr. osborne adds. “the more socialized and handled your guinea pig is, the easier and, more importantly, safer it will be the trim the nails,” says dr. osborne. and the more you interact with your guinea pig, the more social he will be. dr. osborne explains that your guinea pig will love and appreciate the attention you give them during these grooming sessions, and it will help strengthen the bond between the two of you. “some people even put the guinea pigs on a leash and take them for walks,” says dr. osborne. “walking your guinea pig will drastically help wear down their nails, and it will not hurt them at all.” “animals that are not handled and left in their cages are generally more aggressive and sometimes considered mean when, in reality, they just want a little bit of love,” she says.",Regular Nail Trims,Guinea-Pigs_5 Things You Need to Make Your Pet Guinea Pig Healthier and Happier,Guinea Pigs,296,344
"greens added to the diet in addition to commercial dry food, your pet guinea pig will appreciate fresh veggies as treats and an added source of vitamins. “you do need to be careful when feeding your guinea pig fresh veggies, as some can actually be bad for him,” dr. osborne explains. she recommends avoiding citrus, onions, potato tops, beetroot and rhubarb leaves. because guinea pigs need a lot of vitamins and fiber in their diets, leafy greens are an excellent choice, according to dr. daniel j. gray, dvm, from gentle vet animal hospital and cat care clinic. “the rule for greens is nothing on a head (iceberg lettuce or cabbage), and spinach should be used minimally, if at all,” dr. gray says. “otherwise, most of the leafy greens sold in a grocery store can provide an excellent variety and vitamin source for your guinea pig.” in addition, dr. gray says that veggies and fruits (carrots, peppers, apples) should be given very minimally and only as treats. “for example, the carrot tops are food, the carrot itself is a treat,” explains dr. gray.",Greens Added to the Diet,Guinea-Pigs_5 Things You Need to Make Your Pet Guinea Pig Healthier and Happier,Guinea Pigs,182,222
"nutritional supplements vitamin c is plentiful in the wild diet of a guinea pig, but you might need to add it as a supplement for your pet guinea pig. “guinea pigs need low doses of vitamin c in order to avoid scurvy, just like humans,” says dr. osborne. vitamins come in several forms, including tablets, chews, liquids and drops. “sometimes you have to see what your guinea pig likes best, as these all taste a little different,” says dr. osborne. dr. osborne explains, “some people find the vitamin c drops [that] you put in your guinea pig’s water change the taste and result in the guinea pig not drinking the water, which is not good; if your guinea pig likes the chews, then these are a good option for you.”",Nutritional Supplements,Guinea-Pigs_5 Things You Need to Make Your Pet Guinea Pig Healthier and Happier,Guinea Pigs,130,155
"fun hiding spaces a guinea pig house, tunnel or other hiding spaces are essential for guinea pigs to reduce stress. “guinea pigs are prey animals, meaning that they are programmed to fear being eaten by other animals,” explains dr. gray. “so when they are trying to rest or are feeling vulnerable, a place to hide can decrease their stress greatly and increase their quality of life.” in the wild, guinea pigs travel in large herds and mostly graze on veggies throughout the day, says dr. osborne. “this means they are constantly going in and out of small, dark spaces looking for food and playing with other guinea pigs,” she says. “when you give your guinea pigs tunnels and hiding spaces, this helps to simulate a natural forest environment to some small extent; the more opportunities for play and hiding they have, the healthier the mental health will be,” says dr. osborne. try a variety of sizes and shapes when it comes to hiding spaces, like the pyramid-like kaytee woodland get-a-way guinea pig house and the living world small animal tunnel.",Fun Hiding Spaces,Guinea-Pigs_5 Things You Need to Make Your Pet Guinea Pig Healthier and Happier,Guinea Pigs,180,210
"a variety of toys toys are not only fun, but they can also provide mental stimulation to help your guinea pig stay happy and alert. “when choosing chews and toys, i recommend getting a few of everything at first so you can see what your guinea pig likes and doesn't like,” says dr. osborne. the larger the variety of toys and objects your guinea pig has, the more his curiosity will be piqued, which means more mental stimulation. try a mix of hanging toys, like kaytee perfect chews guinea pig toy, and moving items, such as the niteangel small animal ball toys. when it comes to guinea pig toys, dr. gray points out that sometimes simple things tend to work better than fancy ones. “some of the best toys for guinea pigs are items to destroy, like toilet paper tubes or sheets of paper.” he continues, “toys that a human baby can use— [made from] hard plastic and too big to swallow—can also be good toys.”",A Variety of Toys,Guinea-Pigs_5 Things You Need to Make Your Pet Guinea Pig Healthier and Happier,Guinea Pigs,166,193
"avoid dangerous add-ons when setting up a habitat for your guinea pig, the two key things to keep in mind are to make it stimulating and to make it safe. “generally, most habitats that are purchased at the store are very safe for your guinea pig,” says dr. osborne. “it’s adding too many toys and accessories that can end up being dangerous, especially if they’re not designed for guinea pigs and can end up hurting your pet.” when you purchase tubes or tunnels, dr. osborne recommends erring on the side of caution and checking the diameter of the tube. “younger guinea pigs can get into smaller spaces than an adult can, and you don’t want yours to get stuck or hurt as he gets older and bigger,” dr. osborne says. dr. gray also suggests avoiding guinea pig bedding that is heavily scented, like cedar chips. “wood chips that are unscented can also cause problems, as little pieces of wood can get stuck under their eyelids,” says dr. gray. “the best bedding choices are fleece bedding, as long as they don't chew it up, or paper-based bedding, like carefresh.” by: diana bocco",Avoid Dangerous Add-Ons,Guinea-Pigs_5 Things You Need to Make Your Pet Guinea Pig Healthier and Happier,Guinea Pigs,191,229

"basic necessities for keeping guinea pigs as class pets guinea pig care is considered to be fairly easy, though these pets do require daily care and attention . every day, they require timothy hay, fresh water in a sipper bottle, some chopped vegetables (such as leafy greens, like green- and red-leaf lettuce, romaine lettuce, parsley, cilantro, chicory and bell peppers), and a small amount of pelleted guinea pig food. they also require a daily vitamin c supplement in tablet or liquid form, given directly in their mouths rather than in their water, as guinea pigs don’t make vitamin c on their own. fresh timothy hay-based pellets should be purchased every 30 days, as vitamin c content in pellets dissipates quickly. alfalfa hay is not recommended for adult guinea pigs, as it is too high in calcium and calories, but it can be fed free-choice to young, growing or pregnant guinea pigs. occasionally, guinea pigs may be offered small amounts of fruit, including apples, peaches, plums, pears and berries, but sugary fruits, such as bananas and grapes, should be avoided. guinea pigs should not be fed cereals, bread, oats, corn, seeds or nuts, as these foods may lead to gastrointestinal upset. pellet mixtures with seeds and cereals should not be offered, as guinea pigs will pick out these foods and ignore the pellets. guinea pigs should be housed in fairly large cages (at least 1 foot wide and 2 feet long, with walls at least 1 foot high) with solid floors lined with paper-based guinea pig bedding (such as shredded newspaper, paper towel or commercially available recycled paper products sold for guinea pig bedding). wire-bottom cages are not recommended, because they can lead to foot ulcers and entrapment of toes between wires. guinea pig cages need to be spot cleaned daily and completely cleaned weekly. as guinea pigs naturally live in cool climates, they don’t do well in hot, humid conditions. so they must be kept inside, ideally with air conditioning or a fan on them during hot weather so that they don’t overheat. while they are social and may live with other guinea pigs in same-sex pairs or trios, they can live happily as solo class pets. they should not be housed with the opposite sex, unless one is neutered or you are prepared to have numerous baby pigs. they don’t require vaccines, but they should receive an annual physical examination by a veterinarian to ensure that they are healthy and parasite-free, and they will need nail trims every few months.",Basic Necessities for Keeping Guinea Pigs as Class Pets,Guinea-Pigs_Do Guinea Pigs Make Good Class Pets,Guinea Pigs,421,491
"unique guinea pig facts that teachers should be aware of while guinea pigs are straightforward pets, there are a few things teachers should let kids know about these animals if they’re going to keep them in the classroom: guinea pigs feed continuously, so they produce frequent, formed fecal pellets. children holding guinea pigs should keep them in a towel on their laps or on a table so that their clothes don’t become soiled. guinea pigs also normally produce and ingest softer stools, called cecotropes, throughout the day, which provide them with important proteins and vitamins. kids should be informed about this behavior so that they are not surprised to see a guinea pig eating its stool. children in the classroom should also know that guinea pigs move quickly. children holding guinea pigs should be supervised at all times so that the pig doesn’t jump away from the children and get injured. children should be instructed to move slowly and calmly when holding guinea pigs, so as not to scare them. if they become frightened, guinea pigs may struggle to get away or even nip. if this happens, they should be gently returned to their cages and left alone for a while to calm down. while most children are not allergic to guinea pig hair, there may be a few who are. people who are allergic to guinea pig fur may break out it an itchy red rash after handling these animals. any child demonstrating these signs should be seen by a physician immediately. and while guinea pigs don’t generally carry diseases that are commonly transmittable to people, children handling guinea pigs should always wash their hands immediately after returning these animals to their cage. guinea pigs can be great pets in the classroom that can teach children to be responsible and respectful pet owners. when teachers learn about these animals and prepare their students properly, both the pets and the kids can thrive in the classroom.",Unique Guinea Pig Facts That Teachers Should Be Aware Of,Guinea-Pigs_Do Guinea Pigs Make Good Class Pets,Guinea Pigs,326,358

"bathing do’s & don’ts dr. mickley notes that when deciding whether to get a long-haired guinea pig, you should take into consideration that they are inherently messier than short-haired guinea pigs and will need to be cleaned often. this can be done at home if the pet parents understand safe handling, especially in the tub or sink. known for holistic pet care and volunteering her grooming skills at a local animal shelter to encourage more adoptions, wolff-foster uses a coconut surfactant-based shampoo, like the earthbath hypo-allergenic dog and cat shampoo, to bathe guinea pigs, and doesn’t use any conditioners or leave-in products, since most guinea pigs also clean themselves. wolff-foster recommends placing the guinea pig on a folded towel in the basin of the tub or sink during baths to help them to feel secure and avoid any slipping issues. holding them gently with one hand while bathing with the other will prevent sudden jumps that can cause an accidental fall. she says that you should never use a grooming “loop” around a guinea pig’s neck. after bathing, it’s important to clean and dry both sides of the ear flaps, but never use a cotton swab inside the ear. she doesn’t recommend using blow dryers, but suggests providing a warm, quiet space for them to air-dry and then combing to remove any loose hairs.",Bathing Do’s & Don’ts,Guinea-Pigs_How to Groom Long-Haired Guinea Pigs,Guinea Pigs,224,259

"avoiding stress for your guinea pig “avoid loud and sudden noises and anything else that seems to agitate them,” nevarez says. “most owners quickly learn to recognize the noises they make, including those associated with being scared.” guinea pigs can be prone to stress, so the cage should be placed in an area where there isn't a lot of noise or traffic. one good option is placing the enclosure in a room that's visited regularly but that doesn't have constant traffic. a little hide box, such as an upside down cardboard box with a door cut in one side, in the cage will also help control stress, he said, as your guinea pig can then hide and feel safe. pet owner matt kovacs got two guinea pigs for his daughter, audrey, two years ago. dottie and kathy, named after audrey's grandmothers, live in a wire cage with a green hideout structure. “we put kathy and dottie in audrey’s play room, so they would get views throughout the room and out the front window to the outside world,” says kovacs. “the cage is on top of a desk to provide easy access when they are taken out to play, as well as to give them the best views.” be sure that if you use a wire cage, however, that the floor is solid, so that the pets don’t develop sores on their feet from pressure on the wire, and that the wire doesn’t contain metals, such as zinc, which guinea pigs can become sick from chewing on.",Avoiding Stress for Your Guinea Pig,Guinea-Pigs_Setting Up and Decorating Your Guinea Pig Cage,Guinea Pigs,256,297

"what do guinea pigs eat? hay is the most important part of your cavy’s diet. guinea pigs should have unlimited, access to high-quality grass hays. timothy and orchard grass hays are popular, but guinea pigs also do well with meadow, oat, or brome hay. unlimited access to hay helps prevent common dental and gastrointestinal disorders. grasses are abrasive and help to wear down the continuously growing teeth of a guinea pig. without this stimulation, teeth easily become overgrown, abscessed, or make the cavy unable to eat normally. alfalfa or clover hay should be used only in juvenile or pregnant cavies, as it is high in calories and calcium, leading to obesity, abnormal calcification, and bladder stones. most veterinarians recommend oxbow hay products for their safety and nutritional value. vegetables are the next important part of a cavy’s diet. use caution when introducing new food items, as it may cause gas or diarrhea. once your guinea pig is familiarized with many vegetables, you can offer ½ to 1 cup of a mixture daily. aim for two or three different types of vegetables each day. pellets can be offered in limited quantities—typically 1-2 tablespoons per cavy. make sure to use guinea pig–specific pellets. high-quality grass pellets are an important part of a cavy’s diet but are never a replacement for hay. always make sure to provide unlimited grass hay in addition to small amounts of pellets. veterinarians typically recommend oxbow as a high- quality and safe brand. never feed pellets with seeds, nuts, or dried fruits. fruits and treats should be offered sparingly—once or twice a week, not daily. these often are empty calories with no nutritional value to the cavy. treats are high in sugar as well, leading to obesity and gi issues. many guinea pigs enjoy alfalfa cubes, carrot tops, and apples as the occasional treat. vitamin c is a required supplement for all cavies. unlike many other species, guinea pigs cannot produce their own vitamin c, so they must obtain it from their diet. low vitamin c leads to conditions like scurvy and other illnesses. if your guinea pig is sick with any illness, additional vitamin c may be required, but always ask your veterinarian for the amount for your pet. oxbow is a trusted brand of supplemental vitamin c. veterinarians do not recommend adding vitamin c to the water, as it can degrade quickly and also taste abnormal, thus decreasing the amount the guinea pig is willing to drink and possibly lead to dehydration. many guinea pig pellets are also fortified with vitamin c, but because of the degradation through exposure to light, heat, or dampness, they may not have nearly enough. the most trusted way to provide supplemental vitamin c is through tablets, in addition to vegetables high in vitamin c. water should be provided at all times. most guinea pigs do best with a sipper bottle attached to the side of the cage. however, inspect it frequently because many guinea pigs like to play with and chew the bottles.",What Do Guinea Pigs Eat?,Guinea-Pigs_What Can Guinea Pigs Eat,Guinea Pigs,503,578

"domestication of guinea pigs guinea pigs were domesticated originally by the incas as early as 5000 bc. in the 1600s, guinea pigs were brought to europe by spanish, english, and dutch explorers. since then, breeders have bred certain traits, resulting in the 13 breeds of guinea pigs that the american cavy breeders association recognizes today—and more are added all the time. based on selective breeding, guinea pigs now have a variety of coat colors, patterns, and textures. queen elizabeth i even kept a guinea pig as a pet, establishing their role in royal societies as pets and companions. the name “guinea pig” is a misnomer, as they are not from guinea and they are rodents, not pigs. it's generally accepted that guinea pigs got their name partially from the squealing and wheeking noises they make, similar to a pig. they may have obtained the “guinea” part of their name from the original cost to obtain a guinea pig, such as 1 guinea. alternate theories speculate that ships from guinea may have carried some of the animals to europe. guinea pigs—both wild and domesticated—are crepuscular, meaning they are most active at dawn and dusk. they don't dig their own dens or burrows; instead, they take over abandoned, established underground homes made by other animals. this is how wild guinea pigs lived when the incas domesticated them. either a now-extinct species or the montane guinea pig were most likely the original domestic guinea pigs, which are bred to be tame and gentle. some guinea pigs—especially those with black coats—were thought in the andean culture to have special powers to diagnose medical conditions like arthritis.",Domestication of Guinea Pigs,Guinea-Pigs_Where Are Guinea Pigs From,Guinea Pigs,272,314
