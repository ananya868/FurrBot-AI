"building the habitat: the best cages and toys for degus since degus have continuously growing teeth, they have a constant need to gnaw and must be housed in secure cages on which they can’t chew their way out. the larger the cage, the better. metal, multi-level cages meant for chinchillas or pet rats are usually fine for housing degus. different cage levels satisfy degus’ need to climb and run. wire mesh cages provide good ventilation and should have solid-bottomed floors and ramps connecting the levels so that degus’ little toes don’t get caught in the mesh. plastic-bottomed tanks meant for smaller rodents are not suitable, as degus may chew right through them. a nest box, such an upside down wooden or cardboard box or a heavy ceramic flower pot placed on its side, inside the cage, should be offered so that degus can hide and burrow. /24, cages should be lined with paper-based bedding to cushion degus’ feet against pressure sores and should contain a wheel to run in for exercise. commercially available paper bedding or shredded recycled paper is ideal, as it is not toxic and is digestible if eaten. wood bedding is indigestible and often contains oils that are potentially irritating to degus’ skin. for a single degu in a cage, cage bedding should be spot-cleaned daily and fully replaced weekly. if more than one degu is housed in a cage, it may need more frequent cleaning. degus also need wooden toys on which to chew to keep their teeth growth in check, as well as dust baths, offered two to three times per week for a half an hour each time, to keep their fur coats shiny and not greasy. commercially available dust meant for chinchilla bathing and offered in a heavy ceramic crock is fine for degus; they seem to enjoy rolling around in the fine dust to keep their fur clean. dust should be removed in between baths, or degus may soil the bath with feces. they prefer living at temperatures from about 65-75°f, as they cannot sweat and become overheated at temperatures close to 80°f. finally, degus do need time every day out of their cages to run around and get exercise. degus should never be left out of their cages unsupervised, as they are curious, adventurous, and fast, and tend to get into trouble by chewing on wires, baseboards, and anything else they can get their continuously growing teeth into. they should only be allowed to venture out into a “degu-proofed” room where there are no loose wires to chew on or tiny spaces to crawl into and get stuck.",Building the Habitat: The Best Cages and Toys for Degus,Degu Information and Care Sheet,Hamsters,437,497
"diet: the best foods for degus degus are herbivores (vegetable-eaters) that eat leaves and shrubs in the wild. as a consequence of feeding on high fiber grasses in the wild, degus’ gastrointestinal tracts are intolerant to sugar. when fed too much sugar, degus develop diabetes and as such have been used as research models for understanding human diabetes. thus, pet degus should not be fed sugary treats but should be offered commercially available rodent pellets or blocks (those made for rats are generally fine) along with leafy greens, such as dark lettuces and dandelion greens, plus vegetables, such as sweet potatoes, cucumber, bell peppers, and carrots, and unlimited amounts of grass hay such as timothy or orchard grass. alfalfa hay should be given only occasionally, as it is too high in protein and calories and may lead to obesity. hay is essential not only to provide fiber to the intestinal tract but also to help wear down continuously growing teeth as it is chewed. food should be offered twice a day in heavy, non-tippable bowls. not only sugary foods, such as fruit or treats containing molasses or honey should be avoided, but also high-fat seeds or nuts. these types of foods should only be offered as occasional treats. finally, degus should be provided with fresh water in a sipper /24, bottle daily, and food dishes should be cleaned with hot, soapy water every day.",Diet: The Best Foods for Degus,Degu Information and Care Sheet,Hamsters,234,269
"degu health concerns degus are generally hardy rodents when cared for and fed properly. if they are fed an appropriate diet, they do not need supplemental vitamins or minerals. they also do not require vaccinations. to keep them healthy, however, all newly purchased or adopted degus should have a complete physical examination by a veterinarian familiar with this species. degus should have annual examinations after that and should see a veterinarian whenever they show signs of illness such as lethargy, decreased appetite, weight loss, or weakness. they also may require periodic grooming, such as nail trimming, every few months, either at home or at the veterinarian’s office, if the owner doesn’t feel comfortable trimming. although degus can be kept generally healthy with proper care and preventative check-ups, they are prone to developing certain conditions, such as diabetes, due to their sensitivity to dietary sugars. they also develop cataracts (milky, hazy looking lenses in their eyes), often as a consequence of developing diabetes. young degus may also develop cataracts as a result of a congenital eye defect unassociated with diabetes. regardless, all degus with cataracts should be checked for diabetes. due to their continuously growing teeth, they are also prone to developing dental problems such as overgrown or impacted teeth and dental infections and abscesses. degus with dental disease may salivate excessively, have trouble eating (drop food from their mouths), eat less or not at all, and lose weight. if dental disease and other medical problems in degus are recognized by a veterinarian early on, they may be treatable. overgrown teeth may require trimming, and dental abscesses may necessitate surgery, as well as antibiotics and pain relivers. diabetes, however, can be very difficult to treat and may ultimately lead to fatal complications such as kidney failure. degus may develop diarrhea if fed an excess of greens and not enough fiber (hay). correcting the diet often will resolve the problem. if not, the pet should be seen by a veterinarian, or dehydration may ensue. occasionally, degus will develop respiratory infections from bacteria and viruses that cause runny noses, wheezing, and even difficulty breathing from pneumonia. degus with these signs should be examined by a veterinarian as soon as possible. finally, if a male and female degu are to be housed together, the male should be neutered. degus reach sexual maturity after about six months of age, and females can give birth to litters of 1-12 babies after 90 days of pregnancy. they also can become pregnant again immediately after giving birth. so, unless you want to end up with a dozen degus, have a degu-savvy veterinarian neuter the males, or house the males and females separately! /24, ",Degu Health Concerns,Degu Information and Care Sheet,Hamsters,445,514

"how to keep hamster teeth healthy petmd.com /exotic/general-health/how-keep-hamster-teeth-healthy by dr. laurie hess, dvm, diplomate abvp (avian practice) hamsters are small rodents. the word “rodent” comes from the latin word “rodere,” which means “to gnaw.” gnawing is a very important activity for hamsters, as their upper and lower front teeth (known as incisors), are covered by yellow-orange enamel and continuously grow throughout their life. it is critical that these small animals gnaw to wear down their continuously growing front teeth as they grow. hamsters also have large, muscular outpouchings of the lining of their mouths (one on each side of their face) called cheek pouches. they use these pouches to transport food, bedding and, occasionally, babies. when filled, cheek pouches look like large sacs that can extend as far back as the shoulder. hamsters use their front paws to massage food out of the pouch when they are ready to eat it.",How to Keep Hamster Teeth Healthy,How to Keep Hamster Teeth Healthy,Hamsters,151,185
"dental problems in hamsters since their incisors grow throughout life, hamsters commonly develop overgrown incisors that may get so long that they interfere with closing the mouth to eat. overgrown incisors also can poke into the gums and tongue, causing cuts and bleeding. if both upper and lower incisors overgrow, they may hit each other when the hamster tries to close its mouth, breaking off and causing pain. hamsters with overgrown incisors also may chew on the bars of their cages, breaking off their teeth accidentally and causing discomfort when they try to eat. once incisors are broken off, they may not grow back in at all, or they may grow in crooked. broken incisors also can cause lacerations of the palate (the hard, bony plate in the roof of the mouth), leading to the formation of an abnormal fistula (or hole) that connects the mouth to the nasal cavity. hamsters with such oral-nasal fistulas may sneeze and have nasal discharge. though it is less common than incisor problems, hamsters can also have problems with their back teeth (known as cheek teeth). since hamsters’ small mouths and tendency to nip makes it impossible for owners to brush their teeth, food can become impacted between the back teeth, leading to bacterial growth, ulceration of the gums and occasionally tooth root abscesses (infections). hamsters with cheek teeth issues may have difficulty eating, lose weight and have swollen lower jaws or swellings below or around their eyes. /24, ",Dental Problems in Hamsters,How to Keep Hamster Teeth Healthy,Hamsters,245,276

tolerant of gentle handling. pet parents should allow newly homed hamsters time to adjust to their surroundings to ensure they acclimate to their new environment. hamsters can be squirmy and should be held over a soft or padded surface to prevent them from injuring themselves if they jump or fall. never squeeze a hamster too tightly or grab them by their tails. hamsters may bite when startled, especially if they are sleeping. children should always be supervised by an adult while handling a hamster. hamster behavior to compensate for their weak eyesight, hamsters use whiskers and their heightened sense of smell to explore and recognize their environment. hamsters are also avid burrowers. adding nesting material to their enclosure can help satisfy their natural desire to build nests, bury food, and tunnel. hamsters have muscular, expandable cheek pouches that they can use to store food, bedding, and other small objects. pet parents should seek veterinary care if their hamster has
