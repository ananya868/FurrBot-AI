tank\u2019s water, the aquarium\u2019s length and width measurements are more important than its height. /24, ideally, the tank should be long and wide, with a large bottom surface area (or \u201cfootprint\u201d) so the arowana has enough space to swim and turn comfortably in the water. always provide the largest habitat possible for any pet habitat. arowanas are known to be powerful jumpers, especially if startled, so their tank should be secured with a fitted aquarium hood to prevent the fish from injuring itself. an arowana's tank should be kept in a quiet area of the home, away from direct sunlight, windows, or air conditioners. setting up your habitat selecting tankmates adult arowanas are solitary fish and it\u2019s recommended to keep them separate from other fish. keeping more than one adult arowana in the same habitat can encourage stress, aggression, and competition. if another fish is kept in the same habitat as an adult arowana, the fish must be large so the arowana can\u2019t swallow them whole, and they should be a \u201cbottom-dwelling\u201d fish (like large catfish species and plecos) that won\u2019t occupy the upper-section of the tank, where an arowana will build its territory. filtration a filter system is an essential addition to any aquatic habitat. aside from keeping tanks looking clean, filters remove harmful toxins like ammonia from the aquarium's water and add oxygen to the water so fish can breathe. an aquarium\u2019s filter should be powerful enough to process all the water in the tank at least four times an hour. for example, a 150-gallon tank (minimum recommended size for an arowana) should ideally have an aquarium filter with a flow rate that\u2019s at least 600 gallons per hour (gph). if only a 550 or 700 gph filter is available, purchase the 700 gph option. power filters (also known as \u201chang-on-back\" filters) and external canister filters are recommended because they offer effective mechanical, biological, and chemical filtration and do not take up as much space. recommended products: eheim classic 600 external aquarium canister filter, 159-gal penn-plax cascade aquarium canister filter, 200-gall marineland multi-stage c-530 aquarium canister filter, 150-gal the water in an arowana\u2019s tank should have a moderate to strong circulation to mimic the water currents and high oxygen levels found

quickly and accurately. adding freshwater aquarium salt to an arowana\u2019s tank can help support the fish\u2019s gill health. if freshwater salt is added to the aquarium, the water\u2019s specific gravity should be kept at 1.004 and should not change more than +/- 0.001 in 24 hours. a hydrometer or refractometer (salt level tester) should be used to measure the salt concentration and specific

(yes, fish do have great memories!) they use their nares to sniff out food and their sensitive lateral line system can feel vibrations in the water around them. however, keep in mind that the cave tetra may be a little slower to their food than their sighted compatriots. you may need to distract other more voracious eaters in your tank or keep your blind tetras with calmer fish. overall, the blind cave tetra is a fascinating and unique addition to any community tank. tropical community fish tanks work best with a diverse range of fish, and the blind cave tetra makes a hardy and easygoing tank-mate. these exceptional fish may need a little extra tlc, but with time, they will become valuable members of your fish world. references jeffery wr, strickler ag, yamamoto y. 2003. to see or not to see: evolution of eye degeneration in mexican blind cavefish. integrative and comparative biology; 43(4):531-541. /24, ",

tinfoil barb, need a tank with at least a 70-gallon capacity to swim and explore comfortably. long tanks /24, with large bottom surface area (or \u201cfootprint\u201d) are ideal for providing extensive swimming space. tanks should be secured with a fitted lid to prevent the fish from jumping out and injuring itself. recommended products: aquariums for smaller barb species (10+ gallons) aqueon led aquarium starter kit, 20-gal tetra glass aquarium, 29-gal glasscages acrylic fish aquarium, 60-gal (must be paired with a fitted aquarium lid or canopy, such as the h2pro glass canopy(a) aquarium fish tank cover, 48-in) you should increase the size of their aquarium depending on the total number of fish housed in the same tank and always provide the largest habitat possible. setting up your habitat selecting tankmates barbs are highly active schooling fish, so it\u2019s best to keep them in groups of five or more from the same species. ideally, barbs should be kept in odd numbers, as they can become aggressive if they form pairs or are left alone. while most barb species can live harmoniously with other types of fish in a community aquarium, pet parents should monitor their barbs for aggressive behavior, like fin nipping. barbs should not be housed in the same aquarium as slow-moving fish with long, flowing fins, such as fancy angelfish and betta fish. barbs are usually compatible with: danios freshwater sharks gouramis mollies loaches rainbowfish new tank mates must be introduced to the aquarium gradually, and pet parents should keep in mind that their tank\u2019s ammonia, ph, and nitrate levels will change when a new fish is introduced so it is important to test the water weekly for two /24, months after new additions. barbs should not be kept in overcrowded aquariums, as these conditions often lead to stress and disease in the tank. filtration a filter system is an essential addition to any aquatic habitat. aside from keeping tanks looking clean, filters remove harmful toxins like ammonia from the aquarium's water and add oxygen to the water so fish can breathe. an aquarium\u2019s filter should be powerful enough to process all the water in the tank at least four times an hour. for example, a 10-gallon tank needs an aquarium filter with a flow rate that\u2019s at least 40 gallons per hour (gph). if only a 30 or 50 gph filter is available, pet parents should purchase the 50 gph option. power filters (also known as \u201chang-on-back\" filters) and external canister filters are recommended because they offer effective mechanical, biological, and chemical filtration and do not take up any space inside an aquarium. most barb species prefer slow to moderate water circulation in their habitat, so you should look for a filter with an adjustable flow rate to slow current speeds as needed. recommended products: tetra whisper ex aquarium power filter, 20 to 30-gal penn-plax cascade aquarium canister filter, 30-gal marineland magniflow 160 canister filter water health & salt content pet parents should test their barb\u2019s tank water weekly for the first two months and then monthly to ensure its ph, ammonia, nitrate, and nitrite levels are stable and within a safe range. an aquarium test kit, like the api 5 in 1 freshwater & saltwater aquarium test strips, can be used to measure key water parameters quickly and accurately. many barb species benefit from the addition of freshwater salt to their aquarium. the water\u2019s specific gravity should be kept at 1.004 and should not change more than +/- 0.001 in 24 hours. if freshwater salt is added to the habitat, a hydrometer or refractometer (salt level tester) should be used to measure the salt concentration and specific gravity of an aquarium\u2019s water. recommended products: freshwater aquarium salt api freshwater aquarium salt /24, refractometers/hydrometers d-d h2 ocean salinity refractometer instant ocean testing hydrometer for aquariums temperature barbs should be kept in warm waters between 72\u201382 degrees f. an aquatic heater should be installed in the tank to ensure that water temperatures stay within an ideal range and do not fluctuate more than +/- 2 degrees in a single day. heaters should be paired with a thermostat to regulate the aquarium\u2019s temperature and prevent the water from rising above the ideal range. many modern heaters have built-in thermostats. the wattage needed for the aquarium heater depends on the enclosure\u2019s size. as a rule of thumb, aquarium heaters should have between 2.5 and 5 watts of power for every gallon of water in a tank. this means that a 10-gallon tank needs a 25- to 50- watt heater. larger aquariums with a tank volume over 50 gallons may need two small heaters, placed on opposite sides of the tank, to prevent cold spots. recommended products: eheim jager thermostat aquarium heater tetra ht40 submersible aquarium heater & electronic thermostat pet parents must check the water temperature of their barb\u2019s tank daily using an aquarium thermometer. recommended products: marina floating thermometer with suction cup for aquariums hde lcd digital aquarium thermometer d\u00e9cor & accessories substrate: pet parents can line the bottom of their barb\u2019s tank with a fine gravel or sandy substrate. be sure that the substrate is appropriate for freshwater aquariums. aquariums need about 1 \u00bd-pounds of substrate for each gallon of water in the tank. for example, a 10-gallon tank will require about 15 pounds of substrate to create a 1- to 2-inch layer. be sure to rinse the substrate with clean, running water before adding it to the tank. recommended products: aqua terra aquarium & terrarium sand /24, exotic pebbles white bean pebbles pure water pebbles coated aquarium gravel plants and rocks: a barb\u2019s aquarium should be furnished with multiple plants and rocks to create hiding places within the habitat. barbs need plenty of open swimming space to explore and school, so make sure that their tanks aren\u2019t overly cluttered or crowded with d\u00e9cor. submerged plants should be well-secured in the tank\u2019s substrate

'stressors' the primary rule to remember with stress is that, as the saying goes, prevention is better than cure. the things that cause stress in a fish\u2019s life (\u201cstressors\u201d) include overcrowding, handling, a poor or unfavorable environment, inappropriate or aggressive fish sharing the same tank and, in the wild, predators. all of these (and others) cause fish to react in different ways depending on the type and amount of stress. fish have evolved and live in a relatively stable environment. their stress responses are consequently better at handling short-term trouble and are not as well-suited to long-term environmental stressors. unfortunately, both types of stress can cause problems. short-term stress for short-term stress, the most common reaction is one everybody recognizes -- to flee from danger. in the wild, the cause is frequently a predator. in captivity, it can be a net that causes the reaction, as the keeper tries to capture a fish for closer examination or transfer to another tank. when a fish senses this kind of danger, it triggers a short-term alarm reaction by releasing hormones, including adrenalin for its locomotory muscles. this will give it a shot of energy to escape quickly. the fish also releases cortisol. problems occur because the fish\u2019s body exchanges long-term health for a short-term boost to relieve the cause of stress -- the adrenalin disturbs the fish\u2019s natural osmoregulation (the balance of salt and water in its body) and the cortisol affects white blood cells and reduces the effectiveness of the immune system. once the panic has passed, the fish must also regain its natural balance. this can take hours or days, even after only a short period of stress. long-term stress long-term changes, such as a poor or unsuitable environment, are handled with the same initial response \u2013 an alarm message to escape. however, if escape is impossible, the fish does not stop being stressed: it begins to adapt to the new /24, the effects of stress in fish environment as best it can. at first, the fish\u2019s body tends to overreact but, with time, it will adapt to reach the best possible balance \u2013 physiologically and behaviorally. throughout the period of adaptation, the fish still prioritizes reacting to the new environment and remains stressed, so its immune system suffers and it is prone to disease. adaptation normally lasts from four to six weeks. however, if the fish continues to be in stressful conditions, such as a constantly deteriorating environment or endless bullying from aggressive tankmates, it continues to try to adapt and extends all the bodily responses as long as necessary. this reduces its chance of survival. in the worst possible situation, where adaptation to the new environment is impossible (such as putting marine fish in fresh water), the fish will exhaust itself fatally. as a fishkeeper, it is extremely important to consider the effects of stress. planning ahead, careful control of the environment and management of the fish population are fundamental basics in fishkeeping. less stress means less disease. /24, the effects of stress in fish ",
