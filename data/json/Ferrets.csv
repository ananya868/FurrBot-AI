"ferret facts ferrets are a member of the weasel family that weigh between one and a half and five pounds as adults and can live between six and ten years, according to the american ferret association (afa). they tend to sleep a lot—18 to 20 hours a day— and are most active in the early morning and evening. male ferrets are called “hobs,” while female ferrets are called “jills” and baby ferrets are called “kits.” a group of ferrets is known as a “business.” they come in shades of tans, browns and blacks, with various color combinations and patterns and are usually neutered or spayed and de-scented when they are between five and six weeks old to reduce odor and aggression. ferrets have a friendly, playful nature, enjoy being around people and love attention. ferrets are very intelligent and can be trained to come when called, use a litter box and even perform a few tricks, according to the afa. they require constant supervision when outside their cage, however, and are not recommended for children under six years old as they can bite. ferrets also like to steal things and hide them, and enjoy exploring (particularly when there’s an opportunity to squeeze into a tight space). ferrets are also prone to a variety of health problems, which can make them an expensive pet, and will often chew things and swallow foreign objects, making ferret- proofing essential, said dr. dan johnson of avian and exotic animal care in raleigh, north carolina. while ferrets make good companions for larger house pets with careful introductions and supervised interactions, ferrets should be kept away from birds, rabbits, hamsters, gerbils, guinea pigs and reptiles, according to the afa. /24, ",Ferret Facts,How to Take Care of a Ferret_ Ferret Care 101,Ferrets,284,330
"life with ferrets consider the following details as you determine whether or not to purchase a pet ferret: their environment: ferrets have a reputation for being escape artists, and johnson recommends single- or multi-level, open wire cage designed for ferrets with a solid floor and a secure door for your ferret’s home. due to lack of ventilation, glass enclosures (such a fish tanks) are not recommended. the cage should be located in a quiet area where the temperature can be kept between 60 and 80 degrees fahrenheit and should include bedding (like a towel, blanket or old shirt) that should be washed a minimum of once per week. a litter box that fits in the cage should be filled with recycled newspaper products or aspen shavings. avoid cedar and pine shavings, which can irritate the respiratory tract, and clay or clumping cat litter, which may be ingested by ferrets, johnson said. clean the litter box daily. their diet: ferrets are carnivores and should eat premium commercial food that is high in fat and protein and specifically formulated for ferrets. they should not be fed dairy products, fruits, vegetables, or foods high in fiber, carbohydrates, or sugar, johnson said. and, of course, ferrets should have fresh water every day. their activity: because ferrets like to chew and swallow things, their toys must be sturdy and have no small parts that can be broken or pulled off. toys made of foam rubber, latex, or plastic that might be chewed should be avoided, johnson said. if possible, create “ferret-proofed” area for playtime by covering openings into walls, blocking spaces behind cabinets and removing any appliances or breakable items. ferrets love interacting with their people, so be sure to spend time at least one hour with them every day and consider having more than one ferret to help keep them entertained. their coats: ferrets are naturally clean animals and groom themselves often. they shed twice a year, however, and should be combed during these times to remove loose fur, in addition to regular nail trimmings and monthly teeth- brushing, according to the afa. regular baths with shampoo made for ferrets can help tame a ferret’s naturally musky odor but should not be given too frequently.",Life with Ferrets,How to Take Care of a Ferret_ Ferret Care 101,Ferrets,371,428

"what precautions should you take when walking your ferret? before taking your ferret outside to walk, be certain that he is proficient at walking inside. also, be sure that your ferret gets used to the sights and sounds of things (such as other people, barking dogs, traffic noise) he might see or hear outside. simply carrying the ferret around outside a few times before asking him to leash walk can acclimate the pet to the outside world. some ferrets get startled more easily than others and may require a few more practice runs outside in an owner’s arms before they are comfortable enough to leash walk. while it would be wonderful to be able to teach your ferret to respond to commands, such as “stop” and “sit,” as a dog on a leash might, most ferrets outside are so distracted by unfamiliar sights and sounds that they aren’t likely to pay attention to commands, even if they do so reliably inside. thus, it’s critical that ferret owners keep a fairly tight rein on their animal’s leashes, as ferrets left on a long leash may eat inappropriate objects off the ground or may run into traffic or toward dogs or small children that may be spooked by the ferret. in addition, since there are many unvaccinated dogs outside, as well as wild animals such as foxes, skunks, and raccoons, all of which may be carrying rabies or distemper virus, which are fatal to ferrets, all ferrets taken outside should be vaccinated against both rabies and distemper. if you are walking your ferret outside /24, and you see a wild animal or dog nearby, pick up your ferret and move away to avoid risk of both disease transmission and injury, particularly if the other animal is aggressive. finally, just as dogs and cats are susceptible to internal and external parasites, such as gastrointestinal worms, fleas, and ticks, so are ferrets. if you are going to take your ferret outside, speak to your veterinarian beforehand to ensure your pet is protected against these pathogens. some parasite preventatives are safe for use in ferrets, while others are not. your ferret’s veterinarian should be able to prescribe safe and effective medications to prevent parasitic infection in your ferret.",What precautions should you take when walking your ferret?,How to Train Your Ferret to Walk on a Leash,Ferrets,373,421

"where should i put the litter box? in the cage is always best, says fiorella. “training a ferret to use a litter box outside of the cage is much more challenging since there are more places to explore, and they usually end up far away from the box when they need it,” she said. “ferrets have a very fast metabolism, so when they have to go, they have to go. if the box is too far away, they won’t use it. i definitely recommend getting them trained to use a box in their cage before even considering letting them loose in the house.” in general, your ferret will already have exhibited where in his cage he prefers to go (probably in a corner), so use that to your litter box training advantage. be open to trying different areas though, suggests fiorella. “they may decide they don’t like the corner you put the box in after all, and you may have to move it.” you can also try putting multiple boxes in several corners throughout the cage to get a feel for which location your ferret likes best. cages with more than one level should have a box on each level to make it easier for your ferret to use it immediately when he has to, said fiorella. it’s also a good idea to attach or tie down the litter box in the cage. “ferrets are big into rearranging their surroundings,” says fiorella, “and they will dig the box away from the wall or out of the cage corner and go next to it, right where the box should be.” /24, ",Where should I put the litter box?,Litter Box Training for Ferrets,Ferrets,270,307
