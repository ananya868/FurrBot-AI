        "text": "malnutrition in sugar gliders malnourishment in pet gliders often occurs when these animals are overfed fruit and underfed protein and nectar sources. pet sugar gliders generally thrive on a diet comprised of approximately 25 percent protein (such as cooked eggs and small amounts of lean, cooked meat, commercially available pelleted diets for insect- eaters, and smaller amounts of gut-loaded insects, such as crickets and mealworms), 25 percent green, leafy vegetables, 50 percent commercially available pelleted foods for sugar gliders that serves as a source of nectar and smaller amounts of fruit (such as sweet potato, carrot, mango, papaya, grape, berries, and apples). rather than sugar glider pellets, many people feed a homemade recipe, called leadbeater\u2019s mix, that combines a commercially-prepared nectar powder with water, hardboiled egg, high-protein human baby cereal, honey and a commercially available vitamin supplement. there are many variations in this leadbeater\u2019s recipe, all of which must be refrigerated and discarded every three days. there is no single ideal diet for pet gliders; variety is key. regardless of their diet, gliders should be supplemented with a vitamin and mineral powder containing calcium that is sprinkled lightly over their food every day. all diets, of course, should be reviewed with glider- savvy veterinarians. malnourished gliders are usually weak, thin, and dehydrated. they are often unable to stand or climb and have broken bones, bruises and pale gums. they may lay on the cage bottom and have difficulty breathing. gliders with these signs should be seen by a veterinarian as soon as possible to have blood tests and x-rays performed to assess their condition. blood tests on these animals often show low blood calcium and blood sugar, as well as anemia. secondary liver and kidney failure also may occur. malnourished gliders must be rehydrated, syringe fed if they\u2019re not eating, given supplemental calcium, and housed in small, padded cages, so that they don\u2019t fall and injure themselves. treatment is generally long-term, and affected animals must be transitioned to a more balanced diet, or they may suffer recurrence of signs.",
