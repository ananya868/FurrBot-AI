        "text": "how do i cut my rabbit\u2019s nails? prepare your rabbit for his nail trim by getting him used to having his feet handled before you attempt to cut the nails. this will reduce stress on both you and your rabbit and make the nail trimming experience less intimidating. while you are petting or cuddling your rabbit, gently handle each foot, spreading the toes apart\u2013 ensuring you can visualize each nail. rabbits have five nails on each front foot (don't forget the dewclaw located on the inner side of the foot) and four nails on each back foot. set your rabbit up for a successful nail trim by following these instructions: 1. place a large towel on a flat surface at waist height such as a table, countertop, or washing machine. make sure you have plenty of good lighting. 2. position your rabbit with his feet down on the towel and his body pressed snugly up against you as if you are cradling a football. avoid the temptation to hold your rabbit on his back as many rabbits don't like this position and may struggle. 3. keep his back legs secure against you so he can't jump or kick\u2014a rabbit's back legs are very powerful, and they can strain their back or even vault off the table when they kick. 4. wrapping or \u201cswaddling\u201d your rabbit in the towel will help keep him calm and prevent struggling which can lead to injury while allowing you to work one foot at a time. 5. to swaddle a rabbit, bring the towel up over his back end first, then wrap the sides over his back and tuck the ends under his body. /24, ",

        "text": "causes of spinal column disorders in rabbits trauma : the most common cause of a spinal problem in rabbits is trauma from an injury. this can happen from an animal attack, road accidents, or kicking if startled or improperly handled. injuries may include a broken back or fractured vertebrae, swelling or inflammation that puts pressure on the spinal nerves, or an abscess that forms from an infected wound. abscess : when bacteria is introduced into the body from a wound near the spine, an abscess may form. this is a pocket of infection that can potentially cause pressure on the spine or introduce bacteria into the spinal column. abscesses can look like a lump under the skin and can sometimes rupture through the skin causing a draining wound. tumor : lymphoma is the most common cancer seen in rabbits. tumors can develop anywhere in the body at any age. degenerative disease : degenerative conditions of the spine typically begin to show in rabbits over 4 years old and are more common in the larger breeds. rabbits can also have a genetic predisposition to some conditions. arthritis happens when the cartilage between the vertebrae deteriorates, allowing the bones to rub together. spondylosis occurs when bony \u201cspur like\u201d protrusions grow out from the vertebrae. over time these spurs can grow together and form an inflexible bridge between the spinal bones. intervertebral disc disease (ivdd) can cause the cushion-like discs between the vertebrae to bulge or rupture, putting pressure on the spinal nerves. obesity : excess body weight can cause a rabbit's bones to alter and deteriorate. this results in decreased bone density which allows for higher risk of vertebral fractures. toxins : exposure to pesticides, insecticides, certain plants, human medications, antifreeze, or paint containing lead or zinc can affect the central nervous system and cause spinal column disorder symptoms. stroke : a cerebrovascular accident (cva) can occur when blood flow to the brain is disrupted, usually by a blood clot or aneurysm. parasitic infection : encephalitozoon cuniculi is a single cell organism that affects a rabbit's kidneys, brain, and spinal cord. it is most commonly passed from a mother to her babies through the placenta. spores can also be passed through an infected /24, animal\u2019s urine and then inhaled or ingested by a rabbit, causing neurological symptoms.",

        "text": "rabbits when a rabbit shows signs of a spinal issue, the biggest challenge for any veterinarian is determining the cause. the patient history is valuable in determining a diagnosis and treatment plan. be prepared to describe your rabbit\u2019s cage, home environment, diet, and daily routine. be sure to explain any recent changes in behavior, appetite, or bathroom habits. a thorough physical exam can provide a great deal of information. your veterinarian will check for normal reflexes, feel your rabbit's feet to make sure they aren't cold from lack of circulation, and gently palpate the spine to find possible areas of pain. depending on the exam findings, a veterinarian may recommend some of the following diagnostic tests: mri (magnetic resonance imaging) is the best diagnostic tool available. an mri provides the clearest and most detailed images of the spinal cord, bones, and surrounding soft tissue all at once. your rabbit will need to go to a specialty facility that has mri capabilities for small animals as the equipment is not available at a regular veterinarian's office. ct scans provide detailed 3d images of the boney structures in the spinal column. x-rays are readily available at your veterinarian's office and are typically less costly than an mri. while not as detailed, x-rays can still show fractures, vertebral luxation, tumors, or narrowed disc spaces. in addition, a myelogram can be performed. rabbits need to be sedated and then a radio opaque dye is injected into the spinal fluid. a series of x-rays are then taken to highlight any disruptions of the dye flowing through the spine. blood work can be helpful to determine underlying disease and possible exposure to toxins. it can also show how debilitated or dehydrated your rabbit is and highlight the need for fluid replacement therapy or nutritional support. other labs tests may be necessary to achieve a definitive diagnosis. a biopsy of a suspected tumor or a culture of an infected wound will help guide you and your veterinarian in making a treatment plan for your rabbit. /24, treatment of prompt diagnosis and treatment can have a profound impact on your rabbit\u2019s recovery, so bring him to a veterinarian as soon as the first signs of a possible spinal problem appear. in general, a rabbit experiencing a spinal issue or injury needs strict cage rest for a minimum of 6-8 weeks. it is vital to your rabbit's recovery to keep stress and handling to a minimum. place you rabbit\u2019s recovery cage in a quiet, secure location away from activity and loud noises. various medications are available to treat rabbits experiencing a spinal column disorder. nsaids (non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs) such as carprofen or meloxicam can reduce pain and swelling. in addition, morphine-based opioids can ease bone pain and are often used for surgical pain management. an antibiotic may be prescribed in case of infection or abscess. if your rabbit is not eating or drinking enough, there are medications to stimulate his appetite. fluid therapy may be administered as well if your rabbit is severely debilitated or dehydrated.",

        "text": "the basics of bunny care the first thing any potential rabbit owner should keep in mind is that some people can be highly allergic to rabbits, developing runny eyes, nose, or even anaphylactic reactions, so it\u2019s worth getting your whole family checked out before purchasing one. families with a history of pet allergies should consult their physicians about testing for allergies specifically to rabbits. since some people are more allergic to some types of rabbits than others, as long as your physician says it\u2019s okay, it may be prudent to expose all potentially allergic family members to the specific rabbit being considered before taking it home. if you are getting a female rabbit, you will want to spay her at about six months of age, as over 70 percent of unspayed rabbits will likely develop uterine cancer after three years. \u201cfemale rabbits should be spayed to prevent uterine cancer and to decrease aggression,\u201d donnelly said. \u201cmale rabbits can be neutered to prevent breeding or territory marking/spraying. spay or neuter is especially important if you want to keep more than one rabbit in the same space.\u201d when determining whether or not to get one rabbit or two, you\u2019ll want to keep in mind that both male and female rabbits can be aggressive towards each other, and you should speak with your veterinarian before deciding to bring home a second rabbit, donnelly said. /24, with the proper care and attention to your rabbit\u2019s diet and environment, most pet rabbits can live anywhere from eight to twelve years in captivity, can be litter-trained and are quite personable and social, donnelly said. in fact, many people allow their rabbits to roam freely in their house when they are home, she said. \u201cof course, it\u2019s important to supervise this activity, as chewing on baseboards and paint chips can lead to health issues ranging from gastrointestinal upset to lead poisoning.\u201d other things to consider include: diet: food for pet rabbits should consist primarily of grass-based hays and a small amount (about two tablespoons per day) of rabbit pellets. \u201cfresh greens are an important supplement to a rabbit\u2019s diet and should include leafy greens such as romaine, green leaf and red leaf lettuces,\u201d donnelly said. limit the darker greens like kale, collards or spinach, as these contain too much calcium and oxylates and may contribute to bladder stone formation. also, avoid feeding excessive amounts of fruits and other sugar-containing foods, as those may contribute to dental disease and gastrointestinal disorders, donnelly added. cage: whether it\u2019s home-built bunny condos, large crates or specialized rabbit cages, the size of your rabbit\u2019s habitat should be determined by its size. bigger is better (it should be least six-times the length of your stretched-out bunny), as you\u2019ll want to make sure that your furry friend has room to run around, play and hide. make sure your rabbit\u2019s cage has solid or slatted plastic floors, and avoid wire-bottomed ones that cause ulcers to form on the bottom of their feet. your rabbit will also require a water bottle or heavy bowl (rabbits are known for over- turning lighter bowls), a plastic litter box and a play house where he can hide out when he\u2019s feeling particularly tired or shy. toys: most rabbits enjoy spending time with their people, so supervised playtime with your rabbit outside of its cage is recommended as often as possible. rabbits love playing with almost any kind of toy, but should be given rabbit toys that are safe to hide in or chew on (like empty paper towel and toilet paper rolls). rabbits can also play with hard, plastic cat toys that can\u2019t easily be ingested and that can be rolled or tossed at them, or other toys that can be hung from their cage for reaching or swatting. handling: remember that rabbits can be skittish (especially if they are small), so you\u2019ll need to handle your rabbit with care. some rabbits don\u2019t like to be held at all and would much prefer their freedom to roam around on their own, although a gentle pat or scratch from time-to-time is usually welcome. if you do pick up your bunny, be sure to hold it close to your body and support its hind end well, as rabbits like to kick and can easily break their backs if their back ends are not supported. /24, grooming: your rabbit shouldn\u2019t need baths like other animals (in fact, baths should actually be avoided for the stress they may cause) as they are naturally very clean. they will need their nails trimmed at least every six weeks, however, and their coats should be brushed at least once a week (or more if he has long fur or is shedding a lot). before attempting to trim your rabbit\u2019s nails on your own, consult with your vet first for the proper technique, since nail trimming requires restraining your bunny and using special nail clippers, which could lead to bleeding if your rabbit\u2019s nails are cut too close to the quick. /24, ",
