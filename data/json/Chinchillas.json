        "text": "dental disease chinchillas have open-rooted or continuously growing teeth that grow 2-3 inches per year. in the wild, they eat rough, coarse grasses that help keep these continuously growing teeth worn down. many pet chinchillas are fed excessive amounts of dry, crumbly pellets, rather than fibrous hay, and as a result, they don\u2019t chew enough and their teeth don\u2019t wear down properly as they grow. in addition, their top and bottom teeth must meet properly to help wear them down as they grow. a condition called malocclusion occurs when the teeth don\u2019t align properly, so that the teeth surfaces hit each other inside the mouth. once the teeth grow so long that they hit, there is no room for them to grow longer, and they become impacted in the gums and jaw bone (like wisdom teeth in people). both the front (incisor) teeth and back (molar) teeth can become impacted \u2014 a very painful condition when the chinchilla tries to chew. overgrown, sharp edges may form along teeth surfaces, leading to cuts on the tongue, cheek, or lips. the roots of overgrown teeth may become infected and abscessed. the chinchilla may have difficulty eating, lose weight, drool, and paw at its mouth. if an owner sees a chinchilla exhibiting any of these signs, the animal should be examined by a veterinarian right away so that treatment may be started. a chinchilla-savvy vet should perform a thorough oral examination and take x-rays of the animal\u2019s head to assess the teeth roots. if the teeth are overgrown and impacted but not infected, the pet should be started on a softer, easier-to-chew diet (such as shredded veggies and chopped hay), or syringe-fed a liquid diet if it cannot chew at all. it should also be given liquid anti-inflammatory medication. if x-rays show infected teeth roots, the infected teeth must be surgically extracted under anesthesia. prognosis for chinchillas with dental disease is better when the animal is treated early on, before they become weak and thin. in general, however, dental problems in chinchillas are recurrent and lifelong. related /24, overgrown teeth and dental issues in chinchillas",
