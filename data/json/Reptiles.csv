"african rock python diet if you’re planning on housing an african rock python, secure a permanent food source before bringing your new snake home. as they grow larger, they will require prey animals of appropriate size. an “appropriately sized” prey animal should be no greater than the greatest width of the snake’s mid-body. african rock pythons’ growth rate is directly rated to their feeding regimen. most herpetoculturists recommend tapering your snake’s feeding regimen after it reaches sexual maturity (usually around three years) to prevent obesity. hatchling african rocks can be fed baby mice a few times before moving on to adult mice. after the african rock has eaten adult mice a couple of times, you can move on to a feeding regimen. this is a sample feeding regimen you can use for central and southern african rock pythons: from hatchling to 4 feet in length, feed 1 to 2 appropriately sized mice every 3 to 4 days. at 4 feet you can switch to medium rats before eventually graduating to large rats. from 4 feet to sexual maturity, feed your afrock 1 to 2 prey animals every 5 to 10 days or so. during this time, when your snake reaches 6 to 7 feet in length, you may need to switch from rats to rabbits, increasing the rabbits’ size as the snake grows. after sexual maturity, feed one to two rabbits every week to two weeks, depending on the snake’s appetite and overall appearance.",African Rock Python Diet,African Rock Python - Python sebae,Reptiles,244,276

"supplies for housing african rock pythons the care requirements for african rock pythons are quite similar to the requirements of reticulated pythons of the same size. they need an enclosure that’s large enough for growth, a heat gradient that allows the snake to selfregulate (regulate its own temperature), and some interesting places to hide out. aquarium tank or terrarium setup first things first: you’ll need to ensure your snake enclosure has a sturdy locking mechanism and adequate ventilation. a good rule of thumb as far as size of the enclosure goes is that it needs to be large enough for a snake to wrap around it one and a half times comfortably. next, you’ll need to choose a substrate (that’s what we call reptile bedding) and decorations for your snake that are easy to clean and replace. you can use anything from specially made reptile carpet to newspaper for substrate. just don’t use cedar /24, or pine shavings! the oil in these trees can irritate a snake’s skin and cause respiratory illnesses. mulch substrate is a great middle ground since it’s easy to spot clean and looks natural. as for decorations, you can go as simple or as fancy as you please. just remember that you’ll need to clean whatever you put in the enclosure, so a simple hiding log may be better than a fancy piece with lots of nooks and crannies to muck up. heat and light snakes need a range of heat—a heat gradient—in order to properly manage their own temperatures. it’s called thermoregulation and it’s extremely important. your african rock python’s habitat needs to have a temperature range that spans between 86 degrees fahrenheit and 92 degrees fahrenheit. the air should have a daytime temperature gradient between 86 and 88 degrees fahrenheit, dropping to 80 degrees at night. there should also be a hot spot in the enclosure that’s a constant 88-92 degrees fahrenheit. this can be achieved with an under-tank heater, space heaters in the room where your enclosure is, or overhead lights. take care that no heating element is placed directly in the enclosure, like light bulbs that don’t have protective wiring. do not use heat rocks for your snake’s hot spot because snakes like to wrap around them and will burn their skin. when it comes to heating a giant snake enclosure, these are the industry standard options. pig blankets these are giant heating pads enclosed in rigid plastic; they emit high surface heat over a broad area and are controlled by thermostats. pig blankets can only be special ordered through reptile specialty or feed stores. they are without a doubt the best commercially produced heating units for large reptiles. heat pads and tapes these are the easiest way to heat snake enclosures; just make sure you’ve got them connected to thermostats to ensure a proper gradient. ceramic heaters these can be used as overhead heat sources, but they require the correct wattage bulb and sturdy ceramic bases that can handle the wattage. plastic sockets sometimes have cardboard liners that will begin to burn after just a few hours. always use thermostats or rheostats for regulation with these types of heaters. /24, ",Supplies for Housing African Rock Pythons,African Rock Python - Python sebae,Reptiles,529,593
"african rock python habitat and history the african rock python is native to the continent of africa and prefers to make its home in the rocky outcroppings and savannahs where it can hide. they’re nocturnal and enjoy climbing trees and branches at night, where they can ambush prey. the species hasn’t moved around too much, and since it isn’t a very popular snake to breed and keep, there isn’t a large quantity of them outside of the snake aficionado crowd. the one exception to this is in the florida everglades national park, where the rock python has made its home and joined up with two other invasive species: the burmese python and boa constrictor. these species have been wreaking havoc on the local ecosphere. in fact, scientists think the african rock python may pose a bigger problem than the burmese python because it is more aggressive. this invasion of non-native snakes in the florida everglades is largely due to people buying hatchling african rock pythons and then releasing them into the wild once they grow too large to keep. that’s why giant snakes aren’t the right type of pet for everyone! additionally, back in 1992, hurricane andrew destroyed a number of zoos and breeding facilities, which enabled the release of a number of large breed snakes into the local community. this article was verified and edited for accuracy by dr. adam denish, vmd. /24, ",African Rock Python Habitat and History,African Rock Python - Python sebae,Reptiles,234,263

"axolotl health concerns the most common issues with axolotls come from their aquatic environment. unlike most fish, amphibians do not have a protective scaly coat. this makes their skin more prone to nicks and tears. even with their amazing healing abilities, axolotls also have to protect their delicate external gills. make sure that all your aquarium décor has no sharp edges and remove anything that your axolotls are getting stuck under or struggling to move around. juvenile axolotls are prone to accumulating air in their abdomens. air leads to a distended abdomen and to floating upside-down. this occurs due to their immature gut adapting to a higher protein diet. this syndrome will correct itself with time as the animal matures, but reducing portion size can have more immediate resolution. never try to “burp” the air out of your axolotl. another floating syndrome can be caused by small tears in the lungs, allowing air to be free elsewhere in the body. your veterinarian will need to take radiographs, commonly known as x-rays, to determine the location of the air. axolotls are most susceptible to various skin diseases. the most common cause of skin lesions and blisters is poor water quality. it is highly recommended that you purchase a water quality test kit and test your water regularly with any aquatic /24, animal. they are also susceptible to external skin parasites, which are easily diagnosed by microscopic examination of the skin. as with other skin issues, skin parasites are often secondary to poor water quality. another causative factor behind skin blisters is ambystoma tigrinum virus (atv). this virus is fatal. once a diagnosis has been established, steps need to be taken to protect the other axolotls from disease spread. unfortunately, the only resolution is early euthanasia of the infected animal, along with complete cleaning of any infected habitat systems with bleach or complete replacement of all habitat supplies.",Axolotl Health Concerns,Axolotl - Ambystoma mexicanum,Reptiles,316,353

"building an axolotl habitat it is recommended to start with one axolotl in a 10-gallon tank. if you have used the tank as a terrarium or other land-based system previously, make sure to clean it thoroughly with bleach and rinse it very well. multiple axolotls housed together will require their own territory. while they are peaceful animals, and both genders cohabitate well with each other, there may be occasional nips, accidental bites, or breeding scuffles in a tank environment. adding caves, which can be as simple as pvc pipes of appropriate size, along with soft plants or large rocks, will provide a safe space for each animal. no more than three axolotls can be kept in a 10-gallon tank. axolotls require brackish water — a mix between fresh and salt water. this is one of the main reasons that axolotls are not recommended for first-time aquatic pet owners. it is recommended that owners be very familiar and comfortable with basic freshwater aquariums before starting with axolotls. a specialized axolotl water recipe is necessary for optimal health. one well-known solution, mixed by german axolotl researcher johannes holtfreter, requires that the water be filtered through a carbon and particulate filter, a uv light, and treatment with a dechlorinator, or water that has been deionized or distilled. the solution is made as follows: holtfreter’s solution (per liter of water) nacl (salt – non-iodinized) 3.46 grams kcl (potassium chloride) 0.05 grams cacl2 (calcium chloride) 0.1 grams /24, nahco3 (sodium bicarbonate) 0.2 grams pre-mixed formulas are also available for purchase at your local pet supply store. regardless of your water concoction, axolotls need to be kept in a tank with a good filter and gentle water flow. you will need a filter with adjustable flow. axolotl gills can easily be damaged by high, rapid water flow and poor water quality. before your axolotl aquarium is ready for your pet to live in it, the tank will need time to cycle for ammonia conversion to nitrite, and finally nitrate. during this 4-6 week period, you will need to perform frequent water changes to remove these compounds. use a test kit and watch for spikes in ammonia and nitrite, until it finally reaches the appropriate level of nitrate. once you are fully converting to nitrate, you will need to keep your nitrate levels low with regular water changes. live plants can take up a portion of the nitrate, but it is better to do regular water changes to remove other stressful components of water quality along with the nitrate. you do not need a heater in an axolotl tank. in warmer climates, you may even need to add a chiller to your tank to keep your water within the optimum temperature range. the ideal temperature for axolotls is between 60-64° f (16-18° c). axolotls do not hibernate, so you do not need to worry about varying the temperature seasonally. make sure your tank is kept out of direct sunlight, which can cause temperature swings and increased algae growth. when housing axolotls, keep in mind that they are very curious and will attempt to ingest anything that looks or smells like food. this includes any substrate (e.g., rocks, gravel) you place in your tank. anything smaller than 3 cm will be ingested. bowel obstructions are common in axolotls and may require surgery to correct. if you suspect your axolotl may have been eating something they shouldn’t, contact your local exotic or aquatic veterinarian as soon as possible. do not attempt to correct the obstruction yourself. large rocks are best for substrate and will also give your axolotls spaces to find privacy. you can add some fake or real plants to your tank, but remember to keep them soft in order to prevent skin tears. the most important thing you can do to support your axolotl’s health is to provide clean water and good diet. like all other aquatic tanks, your axolotl tank will require regular maintenance. when it comes time for maintenance, you will need a siphon to get between rocks and crevices to remove waste. a regular gravel siphon will not work well for this, but you can use the siphon tubing without the siphon. you will also need to perform regular water changes, physically removing old tank water and replacing it with new, appropriately conditioned water. the amount and frequency of changes will depend on your filter and tank capacity, how many axolotls you keep, and how much they are fed. the most common cause of disease in all aquatic animals is secondary to poor water quality. /24, ",Building an Axolotl Habitat,Axolotl - Ambystoma mexicanum,Reptiles,762,869

"blue-tongued skink diet feeding your blue-tongued skink blue-tongued skinks are omnivores, eating both plants and meat, but their diet should consist of about 70% fresh fruits, vegetables, and other plant matter—great news if you don’t like the idea of bringing live insects into your home to feed your skink! /24, frozen vegetables can be used, but shouldn’t be used exclusively because they don’t have enough thiamine to support a healthy skink. make sure your blue-tongued skink has a varied diet, consisting of about 50% vegetables and greens, 20% fruits and flowers, and 30% animal protein in the form of meat, fish, invertebrates, or rodents. vegetables to feed your skink can include kale, prickly-pear pad, fresh okra and corn, grated carrot, green beans, beets, turnips, collards, bok choy, and endives. calcium-rich fruits and flowers like raspberry, strawberries, roses, and blueberry can make up the remainder of the vegetarian portion of your skink’s diet. a word of caution: do not feed your skink avocado (it’s toxic), lettuce, spinach, acidic citrus fruits (they cause diarrhea), and rhubarb (another poison). as for the meat in your blue-tongue’s diet, whether or not you cook the meat is a matter of preference; see what your skink prefers. if you try raw meat, beef heart and liver are both excellent options—you can ask for them in the meat department of most grocery stores. you can also feed your blue-tongued skink baby pinkie mice, baby rats, and insects like giant mealworms or crickets. you can also occasionally supplement them with low-fat, high-quality canned dog or cat food. the amount of food to feed your skink depends on its size and age, but generally speaking you’ll want to offer babies and young skinks food as often and as much as they want over a six-day period, and then letting them fast on the seventh day. adult skinks can be offered fresh food every other day. place the food in a shallow dish and always remove any uneaten portions. another important note: never leave live prey in the cage with your skink overnight. an understandably frightened prey animal can cause injury to your dragon, sometimes severe enough for emergency care.",Blue-Tongued Skink Diet,Blue-Tongued Skink - Tiliqua,Reptiles,360,441
"blue-tongued skink health blue-tongued skinks as a whole are a relatively hardy, easy-to-care for lizard. since they live in a completely different environment than humans and other mammals, keeping them as healthy pets requires close observation, proper hygiene, and devotion. it’s in your and your new pet’s best interest to find a qualified reptile veterinarian before you even bring your skink home. even reptiles may require veterinarian attention at some point, especially ones with lifespans as long as the skink. you’ll have to call around and look for a vet that specializes in “exotics,” and that has experience with reptiles—ideally, with blue-tongued skinks. /24, common health issues in blue-tongued skinks if your blue-tongued skink is ill or stressed it may stop eating and spend most of its time in hiding. pet reptiles in general can succumb to a number of diseases and illnesses. the following is a short summary of commonly seen blue-tongued skink diseases and disorders. raw nose this condition is found in wild-caught skinks and nervous captive pet skinks. it’s characterized by an irritated or bleeding nose, which is caused by the skink rubbing its snout on its habitat enclosure. claw (nail) problems these are quite common because in the wild, blue-tongued skinks’ nails are naturally filed down as they walk, but in captivity their claws need to be cut periodically. check your blue-tongue’s feet every six to eight weeks and if you notice a lot of growth, clip them with a pair of nail clippers. be very cautious when clipping, as each nail has a blood vessel and will bleed if cut into, so don’t go too short. shedding (sloughing) complications also called dysecdysis, this happens if the skink’s environment isn’t humid enough to support regular skin shedding. keeping the animal’s substrate damp by spraying it once or twice daily will help prevent this from happening. a note on skink sloughing: they shed their skin in patches, not all at once like snakes. internal and external parasites regularly check your skink for ticks and remove them if found. mites are another type of external parasite, but they must be eradicated in stages. a mite infestation looks like a white, red, or black wriggling dust on the body of your skink. as for internal parasites like tapeworms, lungworms, and roundworms, monitor your skink for things like lethargy and bloody stool. if you notice emaciation or bloody stool seek veterinary help right away. mouth rot also called stomatitis, this is a common health issue in lizards. it’s characterized by a cheesy secretion that comes from the mouth, teeth, and lips. it can happen if the skink injures itself while eating, becomes stressed, or as a result of poor husbandry. /24, dehydration characterized by tight, wrinkly skin, usually around the animal’s neck. thermal (skin) burns these are serious and often caused by heat sources that are placed too close to the skink or are unprotected. blisters and burns should be treated immediately with cold compresses for thirty minutes to avoid complications such as infection. blister disease/scale rot this is often caused by habitats that are too dirty or wet. also called scale rot, blister disease is characterized by large blisters that, if untreated, fill with fluid and rupture, leaving the wound open to opportunistic infection.",Blue-Tongued Skink Health,Blue-Tongued Skink - Tiliqua,Reptiles,545,638
"blue-tongued skink behavior as stated earlier, blue-tongued skinks as a whole are smart, submissive, and interesting animals that make great pets for all levels and ages of herpetoculturist. however, there are some species of blue-tongue that are extremely aggressive and shouldn’t be kept as pets. one of the worst offenders is the tanimbar island blue- tongued skink, which is extremely aggressive and not recommended for families with children. as with any pet that is becoming acclimated to a new home, new blue-tongued skinks may exhibit behaviors like hissing, hiding, or puffing themselves up in defense. when frightened, a skink will curl its body into a c-shape, pointing its tail and bright blue tongue out as it puffs its body up in an attempt to scare away predators. this defensive behavior is typical in newly acclimated blue-tongued skinks and will subside with time and regular handling as they get used to their new homes.",Blue-Tongued Skink Behavior,Blue-Tongued Skink - Tiliqua,Reptiles,153,177
"supplies for the blue-tongued skink’s environment aquarium tank or vivarium setup your pet skink’s home, let’s call it a vivarium, can be made from plastic, glass, wood, or whatever you think will work the best. however, it should be easy to clean, easy to access, have adequate ventilation, be free of sharp edges, and above all, it needs to be escape-proof. the size of your vivarium needs to be big. for just one skink the minimum floor area of 39 by 20 inches (100 by 50 cm) will suffice, but an area of 47 by 24 inches (120 by 60 cm) would be better. remember, these lizards have short legs and cannot leap or climb very high. /24, skinks are territorial, and you should never keep more than one male in the same cage. for these reasons, if you’re planning on owning multiples or breeding your blue-tongues, always have an extra vivarium on hand. substrate for your skink’s home should be somewhat absorbent and easy to clean and replace. you could leave the floor bare, but it may cause claw problems, as noted above in the section on health. wood shavings are an excellent option for absorbing odor and liquid, plus you can spot clean wood shavings easily. newspaper also makes a good substrate, as do certain reptile carpets and certain types of gravel and perlite-free potting soil. branches and shelters having a safe spot to hide away is essential for a blue-tongued skink. you will need to provide two places to hide in your skink’s vivarium. the hides need to be large enough to completely conceal the animal’s entire body; they can be as simple as a cardboard shoebox, or they can be decorative “caves.” just remember that you’ll need to keep whatever furnishing you include nice and clean. we mentioned earlier that blue-tongued skinks have stubby, little legs and don’t really climb because of them. while they don’t like to climb, skinks are still inquisitive little creatures and they do like to clamber over things and explore their surroundings. so while it isn’t necessary to provide logs or branches for climbing, they do make nice additions for fun and for basking in their warm spots. heat and light the most important features of your skink’s new home are lighting and heating. skinks require a gradient of heat so they can regulate their own body temperatures. you’ll need to provide a daytime air temperature between 86 and 95 degrees fahrenheit (30-35 c), and a nighttime temperature that doesn’t fall below 70-75 degrees fahrenheit (21-24 c). using multiple thermometers with digital readouts throughout the vivarium will help you maintain the right temperatures. the substrate itself should be around 95 degrees fahrenheit (35 c) at the hot end and 86 degrees fahrenheit (30 c) at the cooler end. research has shown that blue-tongued skinks really benefit from full-spectrum lighting with uv. the tricky part is selecting the right type of uv for your skink. make sure to purchase lights that emit both the beneficial uva and uvb—don’t be afraid to ask your pet supply dealer which lights are the best. make sure you don’t have plastic, glass, or plexi-glass under the bulbs, as those materials can become hot enough to seriously burn your skink. keep the light/heat source outside of the enclosure and about 18 inches away from any outer surface. /24, humidity (air moisture) blue-tongued skinks require levels of heat and humidity, so keep that in mind when deciding on the material for your vivarium. maintain a humidity level between 20% and 45% by keeping a water bowl in the vivarium (you should be providing a water bowl anyway) and misting you skink from time to time. skinks tend to have the annoying habit of fouling their water bowl as soon as it’s changed, so keep an eye on your skink’s water bowl. a good rule of thumb is to check it every few hours to refill and/or replace the water bowl. water for your blue-tongued skink you will need to provide a nice, big bowl of water for your skink to drink from and bathe in. as noted above, skinks tend to foul their water quickly; check the water bowl every few hours to refill or replace the bowl.",Supplies for the Blue-Tongued Skink’s Environment,Blue-Tongued Skink - Tiliqua,Reptiles,710,826

"box turtle diet what do box turtles eat? box turtles should be fed every other day, as long as they aren’t hibernating. they like to be nice and warm before they eat, so make sure your vivarium or enclosure’s lights have been turned on for at least a couple of hours before offering your turtle food. box turtles recognize food by sight and smell, so you’ll need to stimulate both senses to entice them to eat. feed your pet box turtle two types of food during each feeding. these can be 1) meat products or live foods, and 2) plant matter. /24, acceptable types of meat products that box turtles eat are low fat canned dog food, finely cut cooked chicken, and finely cut pieces of beef heart. dog food should only make up 20 percent of your box turtle’s diet, maximum. as for live food, you can feed your turtle live crickets, mealworms and superworms, earthworms, pink mice, and small slugs or snails. in addition to meat/live food, your box turtle will need plant matter. plants supply valuable minerals and vitamins. acceptable plant matter includes berries and red fruit (turtles seem to like the red and pink fruits best), vegetables and greens (like thawed frozen broccoli, tomatoes, cauliflower, mixed veggies, etc.), and small quantities of other fruits like cantaloupe, peaches, apricots, and apples. always make sure your box turtle’s food is cut nice and small. if your box turtle is a picky eater don’t worry, they like variety and sometimes all you need to do is change up the menu. in the wild, box turtles will hibernate and fast during the warmer summer months. so if your turtle still refuses to eat, even after you’ve offered a variety of foods, they may be entering a hibernation period. this fasting period can last a few weeks, so as long as your turtle remains an adequate weight you’ve got no reason to worry. supplements in theory, if you feed your box turtle a proper diet, you shouldn’t have to supplement it with vitamins and minerals. that being said, it’s a wise idea to give your pet box turtle powdered reptile calcium from time to time. simply coat its food with the powder—throw some crickets in a bag, sprinkle with calcium powder and shake— before offering to the turtle.",Box Turtle Diet,Box Turtle - Terrapene carolina,Reptiles,387,457
"box turtle health common health issues in box turtles box turtles are susceptible to a number of diseases, parasites, and other medical conditions. here are two of the most common conditions. dehydration dehydration is one of the most common problems when it comes to box turtles. many come home from the pet store in a dehydrated state; their skin won’t have elasticity and it will retract deep within its shell. the quickest way to help a dehydrated turtle is to let it soak for several hours in a shallow bowl of tepid water. then, over the next few days, let it soak for reduced periods, limiting the soaks to fifteen and twenty minutes two to three times per day. it’s amazing how this soaking can help turtles rehydrate, some box turtles may even double in weight after the first soak. /24, parasites box turtles are susceptible to parasites, nematode parasites being the most common type. parasitic flies are also a concern. just remember that even if you don’t see parasites in your turtle’s stool, they still could be present microscopically. parasitic flies will lay eggs on box turtle shells or at the site of wounds, even small scratches. these eggs will hatch and the resulting larvae will feed on the turtle’s tissue. this is called myiasis and it occurs in just two forms. one form occurs when many flies lay eggs at the site of a wound and when they hatch, the maggots feed on the turtle’s surface tissue. in this case, you must rinse or pluck off the maggots and clean the wound thoroughly with peroxide or betadine and then apply antibiotic ointment, repeating the process each day. the second form of myiasis is more severe and is caused by botflies. botflies do not require an existing wound to lay their eggs; they’ll create one themselves with a small bite. then, once their eggs hatch, the larvae burrow beneath the turtle’s skin; they look like lumpy masses upon closer inspection. if your pet turtle is infected with botflies you’ll need to either take it to the vet or drain the pocket yourself. even if you begin treatment at home, with any parasite or larval infection, you should seek the care of a qualified exotics veterinarian. for turtles that are kept outside, even part-time, there is a risk of ticks. if you find a tick on your turtle it will need to be removed right away. to remove a tick, firmly pull on its head until it releases. make sure to pull straight up and not at an angle or there is a risk of leaving the tick’s mouth part behind.",Box Turtle Health,Box Turtle - Terrapene carolina,Reptiles,441,499
"box turtle behavior box turtles aren’t the most affectionate of pets, but if you keep them in groups you’ll be able to observe a variety of social behaviors as they interact with each other. they do show some level of intelligence, and some pet box turtles will even go to their owners and eat out of the palm of their hand. handling your box turtle box turtles don’t like being handled. they do best with limited to no contact, at best learning to come to their owners when presented with food. box turtles make great display animals, though, and with patience, they may learn to eat from their owner’s hand. as with other reptiles, box turtles carry salmonella, so they should never be allowed to roam freely. to avoid being infected with the salmonella bacteria, proper hand washing should be practiced at all times. although anyone is at risk for salmonella infection, this is especially important in homes with children, elderly, or for people who have compromised immune systems (e.g., those undergoing cancer treatment). /24, it is a good rule to always clean your hands after touching your turtle, its environment, or any of the furnishings you keep for your turtle, such as feeding dishes or shelters for hiding.",Box Turtle Behavior,Box Turtle - Terrapene carolina,Reptiles,209,242
"supplies for the box turtle’s environment housing your pet box turtle - habitat or terrarium setup depending on what part of the country you live in, you can keep your pet box turtle indoors or outside. basic outdoor setups need to have a constant temperature between 70 and 85 degrees fahrenheit during the day and no cooler than 50 degrees fahrenheit at night. if you plan to keep your turtle outside, even part-time, and temperatures fall below 50 degrees for part of the year, wait until the temperatures outdoors warm up some before letting your turtle stay outside. basic outdoor setups need to measure at least 4 feet by 2 feet for two turtles. the placement of your outdoor enclosure should have a shaded area; if it doesn’t, it’s up to you to provide the shade. in addition, always make sure your turtles are protected from predators. use a wire mesh cover or cover the setup with a wood frame if you can. indoor box turtle setups are preferred by many box turtle owners. for a single box turtle, use an enclosure that’s a minimum of 36 inches long and 12 inches wide. for two to three pet turtles, the enclosure needs to be at least 48 inches long and 15 inches tall. if you’re using a wood enclosure make sure it’s waterproof, even if it is indoors, since turtles need a relative amount of humidity in their environment. you can do this yourself with a few coats of epoxy paint, or you can just buy one that’s been pre-sealed. for the substrate, or bedding, use a nice 2- to 3-inch layer of peat-based potting soil mixed with fine orchid bark. make sure the potting soil does not include perlite in its mix. the ideal box turtle substrate should hold moisture to increase the relative humidity of the enclosure, should allow for burrowing, and should have a rapidly drying surface. small-grade fir bark, orchid bark, or pea gravel works well for retaining moisture. stay away from soggy materials like silica sand or aquarium gravel. these materials can wear down the turtle’s shell and lead to infections. shelters box turtles need a place to hide away sometimes. make sure to include a log or other hiding area for your turtle to go and seek shelter—something big enough for the turtle to fit itself within. box turtles are easy to please, they don’t require any fancy furniture /24, or accessories for their cages; a simple hiding place will suffice. opt for something simple like a wooden half-log or cork hiding place that your turtle can escape to. leaving this detail out of your turtle’s enclosure may lead to a stressed, unhappy turtle. heat and light the most important factor in your box turtle’s survival is proper heating. many of the problems that new box turtle-owners encounter can be solved with adequate heating. indoor box turtle habitats can be heated using either of these methods: 1. using a sub-tank reptile heating unit, or by burying a hot rock heater in the ground medium (substrate). 2. using an overhead incandescent light or spotlight over a basking area. this method should be used in conjunction with a heated floor. the temperature directly beneath the bulb should measure between 84 and 88 degrees fahrenheit and should be connected to a timer that gives 12-14 hours of light each day. box turtles need to have ultraviolet (uv) light if they are kept indoors. the light must have uva and uvb and will need to be placed about 18 inches away from the turtle. remember, no glass, plexi-glass, or plastic can be under the light as those materials filter out the useful sun rays. humidity (air moisture) maintaining a relative humidity between 60 and 80 percent is crucial to the survival of captive box turtles. daily misting helps maintain humidity, as can keeping your turtles on a layer of medium-grade pea gravel that you add water to. one sign that your turtle’s enclosure isn’t humid enough is excessive burrowing. box turtles will burrow to seek out moisture, and if they can’t find it they will become stressed and sick. water box turtles need to have access to clean water, both for drinking and for soaking in. even if you give your turtle weekly baths, your turtle will be at its happiest if it has free access to its own water “pond.” the water bowl should be big enough for the turtle to fit its body into, but still shallow enough that the turtle’s head is above the water at all times. box turtles are usually good swimmers, but they can still drown. you can buy a decorative bowl from a pet store, but that will be more for your own benefit since turtles don’t care what their water dishes look like. many turtle owners use flower pot dishes or shallow ceramic bowls in their turtle habitats. keep in mind that you’ll need to clean your turtle’s water bowl frequently since they do tend to defecate (poop) in their water. /24, if you are keeping your box turtle in an outdoor habitat, you might consider creating a real miniature pond inside the enclosure. pond liners can be found in many pet supply stores and online, and you can decorate the pond with real or fake plants, stones, and even real fish—which also make for a wonderful fresh food supply for your turtle. again, make sure the pond is somewhat shallow and that your turtle can easily climb in and out of it. also, locate the pond in a shaded spot to prevent the water getting too hot, and clean the water daily, either with a water vacuum or filter pump.",Supplies for the Box Turtle’s Environment,Box Turtle - Terrapene carolina,Reptiles,951,1080

"burmese python diet as a rule burmese pythons are healthy eaters, feeding readily and on a variety of animals. you’ll want to secure a permanent food source for your burmese before buying one. a burmese’s growth rate is also directly related to its feeding regimen. depending on whether you’re raising your burmese to breed or not, you’ll need to adopt the right feeding regimen. power feeding your burmese for the first two to three years leads to /24, fast growth, which has good and bad points. whatever you do for feeding, cutting back on the feeding schedule as the snake’s growth slows is the best way to prevent the risk of obesity. hatchling burmese should be given just-weaned baby mice for the first few feedings before moving on to adult mice. though each snake is different, after that you can move on to this general burmese feeding regimen: from hatchling to 4 feet (1.2 m): feed one or two appropriately sized mice every 3-4 days. at 4 feet (1.2 m) switch to medium rats, then graduate to larger rats. from 4 feet (1.2 m) to sexual maturity (10 feet [3 m] in females, 8 feet [2.4 m] in males): feed one or two prey animals every 5 -7 days. by 6 – 7 feet (1.8 – 2.1 m) switch to 3-pound (1.4-kg) rabbits, increasing the size of the rabbit as your snake grows. from sexual maturity (appx. 18 months) to three years: feed one or two rabbits once every week. from three years on: feed one to two rabbits every ten or so days, adjusting your schedule depending on the snake’s overall appearance. how to safely feed your burmese python once your burmese has grown larger than 6 feet (1.8 m) long, you’ll need to adopt safe feeding procedures to prevent injury. these include having prey animals within reach, feeding one snake per cage at a time, and using a snake hook, shield, or wooden board as a buffer when removing uneaten prey. we recommend feeding your burmese prekilled prey since live prey can possibly injure your burmese by biting and clawing. for rabbits, the best method is to ask your supplier to kill the rabbits at the time of purchase. burmese pythons, as well as every other kind of large snake for that matter, love to eat fowl of any kind. however, even though they love to eat chicken (either raw or live and whole), fowl should only be used as a last resort for fattening a burmese python that’s reluctant to feed, or to put a little extra weight on a burmese as part of prebreeding conditioning. if you want to purchase food in quantity, you can buy pre-killed frozen prey and store them in your freezer. the frozen prey will need to be thawed slowly before feeding your python.",Burmese Python Diet,Burmese Python - Python bivittatus,Reptiles,472,553
"burmese python health common health issues in burmese pythons keeping your burmese happy and healthy is relatively easy; they’re considered hardy captive snakes. but there is one essential husbandry practice that can make the difference between life and death, and that’s heat provision. burmese will /24, continue to thrive in mildly sub-standard heat with otherwise good care, but a chronic or dramatic lack of heat will suppress their immune systems, making them vulnerable to a host of health issues. respiratory infections respiratory disease (e.g., pneumonia) in snakes is a common but easily preventable issue. most cases of reptile respiratory disease are caused by inadequate heat gradients in the snake’s enclosure. early stages of respiratory disease will cause snakes to wheeze as they breathe, or they may elevate their heads. a burmese suffering from an advanced respiratory disease will secrete a foamy substance from its mouth and pouching of the lower throat region. if you see this secretion contact your herp veterinarian immediately. if caught early, successful treatment could be as simple as providing a proper heat gradient. if caught late, your pet may need reptile- safe antibiotics and a full veterinary work-up. inclusion body disease burmese pythons are in the same family as boa constrictors, and boas are considered the primary host for a very serious reptile disease called inclusion body disease (ibd), a retrovirus infection similar to aids. it is not contagious to people but is to other snakes. burmese pythons are extremely susceptible to these types of viruses, especially ibd. historically, burmese who are exposed to the virus suffer a dramatic death within a matter of weeks. ibd is marked with symptoms of tremors, seizures, vision loss, loss of tongue control, and the inability to right itself when turned upside down (a condition called “stargazing syndrome”). exposure to ibd can happen when infected snakes have mites and the mites transfer infected body fluids onto other snakes during breeding, and by co-habitation with infected specimens. a good rule of thumb is to never house another boa constrictor species in the same cage as a burmese python. burmese python disease burmese pythons are the main species affected by burmese disease (bd), but it has also been seen in borneo short-tailed pythons, african rock, and blood pythons. bd is a slow, progressive disease characterized by recurring bouts of respiratory infections like pneumonia and involvement of opportunistic bacteria. bd is especially vexing in the herpetoculturist community because there is little to no definitive information about the causes or methods of transmission. researchers have noticed similarities between bd and ibd, but are unsure whether bd is a new strain of the retrovirus or something new. affected snakes should be immediately and strictly quarantined, and euthanasia should be considered. /24, blister disease and scale rot (necrotizing dermatitis) often a result of poor husbandry practices, these two conditions can often appear together. blister disease primarily occurs due to severely inadequate hygiene, and scale rot is caused by a breakdown of the immune system. snake scale infections can have symptoms that range from mild hemorrhage to severe blistering and ulceration. the result looks almost like a chemical burn in the form of blisters and can take several weeks to heal.",Burmese Python Health,Burmese Python - Python bivittatus,Reptiles,534,603

"supplies for the burmese python’s environment aquarium tank or terrarium setup — size matters with snakes the size of burmese pythons, makeshift cages and all-glass enclosures simply won’t do. you’ll want to look for an enclosure specifically designed for housing large snakes. the burmese enclosure should have either a sliding or hinged cover, or a sliding or hinged front with a locking mechanism that will keep your snake from making a great escape. there are several companies that sell molded plastic or fiberglass enclosures with sliding glass fronts that are large enough for housing burmese pythons, or you can have an enclosure custom built. young burmese snakes can start off in relatively small cages, which has the added benefit of making them feel safe and secure. a good rule of thumb is that the perimeter of a burmese enclosure should be at least one and a half times the length of the snake. a 75-gallon (284-liter) enclosure is suitable to house a 6-8 foot (1.8-2.4 meter) burmese. adult female burmese pythons require enclosures of at least 72 x 36 inches (181 x 91 cm), and up to 96 inches (244 cm) long for extra-large specimens. another option for housing burmese pythons is framing part of a room to create an insulated glass-front display, kind of like what you see in zoos. unless you do have an entire room dedicated to housing your burmese, you won’t be able to use plants for decoration. /24, as far as substrates go, easy-to-replace is the main goal. you can use aspen shavings, compressed alfalfa (rabbit pellets), fine orchid bark, newspaper, or pine shavings. for decoration, dry landscape materials like large rocks to bask on, sections of cork bark, dried grasses, and large select pieces of wood can be used. just make sure that anything you put into your burmese’s enclosure is easy to move and clean (when burmese pythons eliminate their waste (i.e., urine and stool), they produce copious amounts of liquid and solid. heat and light the ideal temperature for raising a happy and healthy burmese is between 85 and 90 degrees fahrenheit, but consistently maintaining this temperature throughout the enclosure can prove tricky. using multiple, modern electronic thermometers and combining them with alarms that go off when temperatures drop below a certain level is the best way to ensure proper temperatures are being maintained. the best system for maintaining proper temperatures in your burmese enclosure is to provide a daytime air temperature of 84-88 degrees fahrenheit, with a heated basking area that achieves a surface temperature between 88-92 degrees fahrenheit. at night the temperature can safely be allowed to drop to between 80-84 degrees fahrenheit. as long as there’s a basking area available you should be able to avoid all the health issues associated with temps that are too cool. you’ve got several options when it comes to heating systems, but the main thing to remember is that giant snakes need to be given the opportunity to thermoregulate (self-regulate their body temperature) by having about a third of the enclosure surface heated to 88-90 degrees fahrenheit. no matter what heat option you choose, take special care to ensure there aren’t any exposed heat elements that could burn your snake. listed below are some of your heat source options. heat pads and tapes by far the easiest way to heat enclosures, just make sure they’re connected to thermostats and temperature probes. pig blankets these plastic-enclosed heating pads can only be special-ordered through feed stores and are the best commercially produced heating units for large reptiles. they are large, rigid plastic-enclosed units that emit high surface heat over broad areas. pig blankets must be controlled with appropriate thermostats. ceramic heaters /24, these make for a good source of overhead heat; just make sure you select the right wattage bulb for the size of your enclosure and that the ceramic base can handle the wattage. plastic sockets with cardboard liners will burn after just a few hours. like every other heat source, using rheostats or thermostats is crucial. incandescent lighting incandescents can be used to keep your burmese warm, just make sure to measure the temperature at the basking area immediately underneath the fixture and at the distance farthest from the bulb after the bulb has been on for at least one hour. incandescent bulbs must always be on the outside of the enclosure where the light can’t burn the snake. space heaters and room heaters if you’ve got an especially large collection or special snake room, you can use space heaters. take special care to not let these overheat. hot rocks while “hot rock” heaters can present problems when snakes curl around them and burn themselves, they can be useful for raising hatchling pythons. just be careful as it takes a while for a snake to realize that it is on a hot rock. in that time, the hot rock can cause a burn or ulcer on the snake’s body.",Supplies for the Burmese Python’s Environment,Burmese Python - Python bivittatus,Reptiles,826,936
"burmese python habitat and history burmese pythons are native to the indo-chinese regions of borneo, southern china, hainan, hong kong, java, burma, sulawesi, sumbawa, thailand, and vietnam. the burmese pythons that have been established in captivity in the u.s. originated from thailand, but in recent years the majority of burmese imported into the u.s. are from vietnam and indonesia. unlike other snake species that have been bred to create various morphs, the burmese python hasn’t been altered too much through breeding. the most significant change in breeding being the achievement of a dwarf burmese python. burmese pythons may seem sluggish in the wild, waiting alongside game trails and rainforest watering holes to grab their prey, but they’re far from helpless. burmese are actually excellent tree climbers and like to swim and bathe (the water supports their body weight). burmese pythons used to be the standard prop of every self-respecting snake charmer, but these days they reside mostly in zoos, nature centers, and on display at pet shops. /24, although they are known for being generally gentle and docile, burmese python populations have created an environmental crisis in south florida, where they have thrived in the aquatic wilderness of the florida everglades. the first sightings of burmese pythons in the everglades occurred in the 1980s, but after hurricane andrew destroyed a number of zoos, breeding grounds, and wildlife refuges in 1992, allowing a large number of animals to escape into the wild, the numbers of burmese began to grow dramatically. with few natural predators to keep the population in check, they have since established a large population that continues to grow. for the south florida ecosystem, the burmese are an invasive species that feeds on young crocodiles, birds, and small mammals (some of which are already endangered) like marsh rabbits bobcats, raccoons, opossums, and foxes. there is a valid growing fear that burmese pythons will soon hunt some native species, like marsh rabbits, into extinction. there have been known attacks on much larger animals as well. in 2006, florida wildlife researchers found a 13-foot burmese that had died in the process of attempting to swallow a 6-foot-long alligator, which also died. the florida fish and wildlife conservation commission has responded by holding annual snake removal programs to cull the numbers of pythons and other invasive reptile species, as well as issuing hunting permits to qualified applicants. however, burmese pythons have been very successful in hiding themselves away in the neutral-toned everglades that so closely matches their own skin. of the thousands that are believed to be living in the florida everglades, the numbers of pythons caught by trappers and hunters only amounts to hundreds each year. on the opposite extreme, pythons have been highly sought and hunted for centuries to be used as food, for their prized skins, and for use in various local medical remedies. this overexploitation has landed some species and subspecies on the endangered species list, namely the indian python and the burmese python. despite the burmese python being listed as protected in hong kong, china, and thailand, it is still extensively and illegally hunted. this article was verified and edited for accuracy by dr. adam denish, vmd. /24, ",Burmese Python Habitat and History,Burmese Python - Python bivittatus,Reptiles,531,614

"chinese water dragon diet chinese water dragons are omnivores by nature, but they are natural predators and prefer meat over fruits and vegetables whenever possible. they are voracious eaters and enjoy eating different meals each day, which may require you to come up with a feeding schedule to ensure enough variety. if your water dragon becomes bored with a bland diet it may end up refusing to eat entirely, and you don’t want that. as a rule of thumb, your chinese water dragon’s diet should be composed of 85-90 percent insects, with fruits and vegetables making up the remaining 10- 15 percent of the diet. this breaks down to each meal consisting of about 50 percent live insects, 20 percent worms, and no more than 15 percent vegetable. whole prey, like juvenile or baby mice, can be a great source of protein and should be fed to your pet dragon no more than twice per week, and only if your dragon is large enough to handle them. while chinese water dragons enjoy eating just about anything, not all foods are safe for them to eat. listed here are some foods that are safe for chinese water dragons to eat: insects — crickets, wax worms, butter worms, earthworms, silk worms, mealworms, grasshoppers and locusts produce — blueberries, raspberries, cantaloupe, figs, collard greens, sweet potato, carrots, and green beans other tasty treats — small feeder fish, newborn mice (pinkie mice), and fuzzie mice (juvenile mice) building a feeding schedule and other feeding tips when it comes to feeding your chinese water dragon, the amount of food you offer it will vary depending on its size. a good rule is to feed it only as much as it will eat. each water dragon will have a different appetite, so keeping a feeding record of what and when it eats will help you get to know how much your animal eats. the feeding frequency largely depends on the animal’s age. juvenile chinese water dragons need to be fed more frequently than adults to promote healthy growth, while adults require fewer feedings. juveniles usually require daily feedings, while adults may only need to be fed every two to three days. you can feed your adult dragon daily if you like, just be sure to keep the portion sizes small to prevent the dragon from becoming overweight. and don’t forget to always provide your water dragon with plenty of clean drinking water in addition to a well-balanced diet. /24, supplements a well-balanced diet should be enough to provide your dragon with adequate nutrition, but you may still want to occasionally offer supplements. the most common supplement for chinese water dragons is calcium. calcium is extremely important because if your dragon doesn’t get enough calcium in its diet, it can develop a metabolic bone disease. prevent this from happening by dusting a bit of calcium powder over your dragon’s food at least two to three times a week. lastly, always make sure your chinese water dragon’s food source is healthy. purchasing feeder insects and mice from a pet store or pet supply, or raising them yourself, is the best way to keep your dragon from contracting internal parasite infections. be sure to thoroughly wash all vegetables and fruits before feeding them to your dragon (or buy organic) to avoid the ingestion of pesticides and other chemicals.",Chinese Water Dragon Diet,Chinese Water Dragon - Physignathus Cocincinus,Reptiles,559,633
"chinese water dragon health common health issues in chinese water dragons owning a healthy pet chinese water dragon begins with the selection. we always recommend buying pets from reputable breeders or pet shops. always opt for captive-bred over wild-caught because imported, wild-caught dragons may not adapt well to captivity. plus, they usually come crawling with internal and external parasites. once you’ve brought your new pet home, maintaining a clean habitat is paramount to its health. just like any pet, there are several health concerns to be on the lookout for in your pet dragon. the following is a short summary of chinese water dragon diseases and disorders. mouth rot mouth rot is one of the most common health problems and is typically the result of a secondary infection that isn’t treated properly, or an injury that goes untreated. water dragons often rub or bang their head/nose/chin into the walls of the enclosure. this behavior commonly causes rub sores that can lead to full mouth rot. signs that your chinese water dragon may have mouth rot are swelling around the mouth, open ulcers at the mouth or nose, and white curd-like secretions around the mouth. as soon as you notice any of these symptoms you should see your reptile vet immediately. also, try to give your dragon the largest anclosure possible so they are less inclined to rub against the walls. nutritional and metabolic disorders metabolic bone disease, also known as mbd, is an extremely serious and often fatal disease for these animals. it is caused either by a lack of calcium in the dragon’s diet or inadequate exposure to uvb light. signs that your dragon may have contracted /24, mbd include twitching, lethargy, fractured bones, muscle spasms, and swelling of the legs or back. the best solution for mbd is prevention; usually all it takes is to dust every other meal with calcium powder and to always provide exposure to sunlight and/or uvb light. if you see symptoms of metabolic bone disease in your chinese water dragon, see your veterinarian immediately. infectious diseases and parasites when chinese water dragons become stressed it’s easy for parasites to multiply beyond the capability of the dragon’s body to handle. the only way to tell what kind of parasites your dragon has is to see your vet for a fecal exam. signs that your dragon may be suffering from a parasite infestation include lethargy, loose stools, decreased appetite, dull eyes, failure to gain weight, and, rarely, finding worms in the stool. skin infections bacterial and fungal infections are usually a result of a dirty, poorly maintained cage. they appear as dark-colored patches on the skin that can be raised and/or filled with fluid. it’s crucial that as soon as you notice signs of a skin infection that you take your dragon to the vet. only your veterinarian can prescribe the proper medication. do not try to treat a skin infection without your veterinarian’s advice. if the infection isn’t treated in time it will spread to the dragon’s bloodstream and become fatal. always maintain proper hygiene in your chinese water dragon’s habitat and allow the cage to fully dry out between mistings to prevent the growth and spread of fungus and bacteria. dystocia in female chinese water dragons female dragons lay eggs even if they haven’t mated with males. occasionally, a condition called dystocia or “egg binding,” may occur. dystocia is a life-threatening condition in which the dragon is unable to pass her eggs. if you see signs of dystocia in your female dragon(s) seek veterinary assistance immediately. it is crucial that you set up an adequate egg laying box in the dragon’s enclosure, and that you do so early enough to prevent egg binding. signs that your dragon may have dystocia include lethargy, weakness, and frenzied digging, as if looking for a place to lay eggs.",Chinese Water Dragon Health,Chinese Water Dragon - Physignathus Cocincinus,Reptiles,642,732

"green iguana health common health issues in green iguanas the green iguana is prone to contracting a variety of diseases and disorders, but the good news is that due to its huge popularity, veterinarians have a pretty uniform standard of care. the following is a list and short summary of green iguana diseases and disorders, from most common to least common. if your pet iguana is showing any symptoms described below, we recommend consulting your veterinarian. /24, nutritional & metabolic disorders metabolic bone disease (mbd) is the name given to a group of complex bone conditions regularly seen in lizards. usually, mbds are related to a lack of calcium in the diet or lack of proper ultraviolet lighting. however, mbds can be caused by kidney disease and parathyroid tumors as well. symptoms of mbd in green iguanas includeswollen andpainful limbs; the bones of the jaw taking on a misshapen rubbery appearance, preventing the animal from being able to eat; and an involuntary twitching of the muscles. this muscle twitching is known as “tetany,” and signals that the animal is in critical condition or that seizures may occur soon. treatments for mdb include exposure to uv light to provide vitamin d, a dietary correction (in early cases only), and hospitalization with appropriate medications. visceral gout visceral gout in green iguanas is a disorder where the iguana is unable to process the protein it ingests, or is fed too much protein to break down properly. visceral gout is a common cause of death in older green iguanas that are fed too much meat or canned dog or cat food. do not feed your iguanas dog or cat food. secondary visceral gout occurs when the iguana isn’t given enough water and becomes dehydrated and unable to process even normal levels of protein and uric acid. symptoms of visceral gout in green iguanas include irritation and inflammation around the affected tissue areas. if you follow proper dietary requirements, your green iguana shouldn’t contract visceral gout. severely damaged kidneys can result in renal disease and death. infectious diseases and parasites there is a litany of infectious diseases that green iguanas can contract, including postorbital abscesses, oral abscesses, gum and respiratory diseases, bacterial skin , and fungal diseases, not to mention tail cysts. reptiles have primitive immune systems, so if your iguana is suffering from an infectious disease, do whatever you can to help stimulate the lizard’s immune system, whether that means including more nutrition, proper hydration, or adjusting environmental factors. if you suspect your iguana is sick or infected, always seek veterinary assistance. both internal and external parasites pose a problem when it comes to green iguanas. internal parasites interfere with food processing and the absorption of nutrients, causing discomfort and damaging the gastrointestinal tract. it’s important to have /24, fecal examinations performed on your pet to determine whether or not they’re dealing with an internal parasite, even though you may not see them in the stool. internal parasites include nematodes, pinworms, hookworms, cestodes, coccidial agents, and protozoan agents. see your veterinarian for recommended medications and guidance in administering them. the most common external parasites on green iguanas are ticks and mites. ticks can be removed by firmly pulling on them until they release, then by treating the bite area with a topical antibiotic like neosporin. mites are a bit trickier to take care of because they multiply extremely fast. heavy mite infestations on green iguanas can look like fuzzy white or dark colored spots that move on the animal’s body. when mites infest an iguana, the lizard will soak in its water bowl for prolonged periods in an attempt to rid itself of the pests. in order to successfully take care of a mite infestation you’ll need to treat your pet as well as thoroughly cleaning its cage and furnishings.",Green Iguana Health,Green Iguana - Iguana iguana,Reptiles,636,712
"green iguana behavior green iguanas undergo different stages throughout their lives that aid in dictating their behavior. after the iguana is born, it is in the hatchling/juvenile stage and is quite flight prone. this is normal. captive bred juvenile iguanas won’t show aggression or territoriality, but as they get larger they may tail whip when frightened. the hatchling/juvenile stage is also marked by quick growth. when the iguana enters sexual maturity its behavior will change again, usually becoming a bit more aggressive, especially during breeding season. this stage lasts until the iguana is about five years old, when it will stop growing and enter into its mature adult stage. by the time your iguana has matured it will start to show less activity, becoming active in brief spurts.",Green Iguana Behavior,Green Iguana - Iguana iguana,Reptiles,128,145
"supplies for the green iguana’s environment aquarium tank or terrarium setup green iguanas grow at an extremely fast rate during their first years and need a home that will fit their size. a 29 to 30 gallon glass tank is a good starter size, but you’ll need to upgrade to a 55-gallon tank once your iguana reaches 2.5 to 3 feet in length. if your pet grows larger than 4 feet you will need a custom enclosure to comfortably house them. a good rule of thumb is that your green iguana enclosure should always be at least 1.5 times the length of the animal in width, and the length of the animal in height. /24, as for the substrate of your iguana’s cage, you can go as simple or fancy as you like. plain newspaper or brown wrapping paper work just as well as fine- to medium-grade orchid barks. just keep in mind that whatever substrate you choose, you’ll have to clean and replace regularly. the good thing is, iguanas tend to defecate in the same place, which makes spot cleaning and changing simple. another substrate option is alfalfa pellets (rabbit pellets). alfalfa pellets are inexpensive, absorbent, and can be safely ingested. branches and shelters green iguanas are arboreal lizards, meaning they like to spend their days lounging in trees and branches. it’s important to provide branches in iguana enclosures as basking and resting sites. arrange the branches in a way that they run diagonally across the enclosure, allowing enough room between the branches and any spotlights so that the iguana doesn’t burn itself. when adding a new pet iguana to an already existing household, it’s important to provide a hiding place initially. allow the new iguana to become more comfortable in its new home before removing the hiding place and forcing interaction. heat and light temperature is arguably the most important factor when it comes to successfully rearing and maintaining green iguanas. as with all other reptiles, maintaining proper body temperatures is essential to the animal’s metabolism. always make sure you have adequate lighting and heating in your iguana’s habitat. in order to properly digest their food, green iguanas need to be able to raise their body temperature to 85-90 degrees fahrenheit. you can achieve the proper temperatures by placing an incandescent spotlight above the screen or outside of the enclosure and pointing it at a basking area. use multiple thermometers to ensure the temperature of the basking area nearest the bulb does not exceed 100 degrees fahrenheit. hot rocks for heat are not recommended. green iguanas do not do well with hot rocks; they can get thermal burns from too much exposure. in the wild, green iguanas thermoregulate by pointing themselves towards the sun, not by basking on hot rocks and surfaces. while many iguana experts have successfully kept animals for ten years or more without the help of uv exposure, new research suggests that exposure to uv-b can help the animal synthesize vitamin d3. /24, humidity (air moisture) green iguanas also enjoy a humidity level between 70 and 80 percent, which you can achieve by providing a big bowl of clean drinking water and occasional misting. it is a good idea to invest in a hygrometer to ensure the proper humidity level is maintained. when misting, the best way to do so is to lightly mist your iguana a few hours before you turn the lights off for the night. with proper care, nutrition, and a little love you should be able to enjoy your green iguana’s company for many years to come.",Supplies for the Green Iguana’s Environment,Green Iguana - Iguana iguana,Reptiles,596,667

"milksnake appearance milksnakes are members of a large group of snakes commonly called “tricolors” by herpetoculturists and hobbyists. the term refers to the ringed three-color pattern that nearly all milksnakes have. variations in the milksnakes’ coloring can be described as ringed, saddled, or blotched, and the colors are usually red and black on a whitish to yellow background. most of the 25 recognized subspecies of milksnakes are quite similar, with their markings following the theme of bands around the body that vary in number and width. the basic color combinations are red/orange, yellow/white, and black. some subspecies of milksnake look blotched, not banded. with so many milksnakes being bred in captivity, there are a lot of color morphs that exist, as well, with more to come. a small but important note on the color combinations of milksnakes: milksnakes are not venomous, but they have evolved to use batesian mimicry as a defense mechanism, mimicking the colors of local venomous snakes so that their shared predators will steer clear. the folksy mnemonic “red on yellow kills a fellow; red on black, venom lack” refers to the color combinations of the dangerously venomous coral snake that the harmless milksnake resembles. rhymes aside, never approach a snake in the wild, no matter how sure you think you are that it isn’t venomous! /24, ",Milksnake Appearance,Milksnake _ PetMD,Reptiles,220,255

"milksnake diet milksnakes are strict carnivores, but typically aren’t picky eaters—with the exceptions being fussy hatchlings and wild-caught specimens. young milksnakes eat small prey, like crickets and earthworms. adults prefer to feast on small rodents, lizards, frogs, and even other snakes. mice are the preferred small rodent of choice when it comes to securing a readily available food source for your pet milksnake. feeder mice can be purchased at any pet shop, through a rodent breeder, or on the internet. depending on the size of your milksnake, you’ll need to feed it an appropriately sized rodent. pinkies and fuzzies (newborn mice) are best for young or small milksnakes. as the snake grows you’ll want to increase the size and amount of food offered. an “appropriately sized” rodent is one that leaves a small bulge in the snake after it’s eaten. milksnakes do not require complicated feeding schedules—regularity is all they need —so choose whatever day of the week is most convenient for you and make that the feeding day. milksnakes are usually fed once every week, with young milksnakes being fed more often than adults. newborn milksnakes can be given one or two pinky mice per feeding, full-sized adults can handle one or two adult mice or small rat pups. if you’ve got one of the larger specimens of milksnake, an adult will usually eat two adult mice or rat pups. whether you’re offering your pet milksnake live food or pre-killed and thawed food, don’t let an uneaten meal linger in the snake cage. live prey, if left uneaten, can lash out and hurt your snake, and in some cases even kill it. on the other end of the spectrum, a mouse that has been frozen and thawed, if left uneaten, can become contaminated by bacteria and make your snake sick. if you correctly thaw a frozen or freshly killed prey, that is the safest way to go. milksnakes are generally hearty eaters. if you’re dealing with a stubborn or sick milksnake that just won’t eat, take it to a veterinarian. /24, ",Milksnake Diet,Milksnake _ PetMD,Reptiles,342,398
"milksnake health common health issues in milksnakes milksnakes are hardy snakes that do very well in terrariums as pets. however, like any pet, they occasionally have problems. below are several health problems common to milksnakes and their symptoms. infectious diseases and parasites mites in milksnakes are like fleas in dogs and cats, except a lot more dangerous. milksnakes can pick up mites from other infested snakes, or from the pet shop or breeder they came from. mite infestations on snakes can look like lots of white, red, or black dots that, upon closer inspection, move around. mites come out at night to feed on the blood of snakes and can cause serious stress in snakes, and in some cases death. many commercial pet stores sell miticides to clean your snake and its cage with, but take care when using miticides around small subspecies and hatchlings. a safer alternative to commercial miticides is to give your milksnake a quick bath in olive oil, and then carefully rubbing the snake down with a paper towel to remove excess oil. exotic-pet veterinarians also have special medicine to kill mites. mouth rot mouth rot, also called infectious stomatitis, is a bacterial disease that occurs in snakes when their mouths become injured or food or debris gets lodged inside, causing a yellow cheesy substance to coat the snake’s mouth and teeth, eventually eating away at its tissue. dry skin milksnakes can have trouble when it comes time to shed their skin if their habitat isn’t humid enough. if your milksnake suffers from persistently patchy sheds, or if its eyecaps don’t come off along with the rest of the shed, it’s time to visit your veterinarian. respiratory infections upper respiratory infections (uris) are usually caused by fluctuating cage temperatures and/or humidity levels, chronically cold habitats, and over-crowding. uris are also common in snakes that are stressed out and can reoccur if they aren’t taken care of the first time. milksnakes suffering from pneumonia or another uri will often wheeze, hold their heads upright, breathe with their mouths open, and have fluid or crusty secretions around their nostrils. most uris can be treated with antibiotics, so if you suspect your milksnake has a respiratory infection take it to the vet at once. /24, ",Milksnake Health,Milksnake _ PetMD,Reptiles,376,426

"supplies for the milksnake’s environment aquarium tank or terrarium setup milksnakes are a small enough species that you can house yours in a glass aquarium with a sturdy, breathable lid and security clamps. locking mechanisms for the aquarium aren’t necessary, though they may give your roommates a better sense of security. a good rule of thumb is to have your milksnake’s enclosure be one and a half times larger than the length of the snake. you want to give your milksnake plenty of room to explore and uncurl. a proper substrate (bedding) for your pet milksnake’s habitat can include newspaper, wood shavings, a mixture of vermiculite rocks and soil, or even sand. whatever you do, do not use cedar as a substrate. its natural oils can cause liver and respiratory problems in captive snakes. otherwise, you can get as creative as you like when it comes to choosing a substrate, just keep in mind that you’ll have to clean and replace whatever you choose. the typical terrarium will have a two-inch layer of substrate that, between spot cleanings, should be removed and replaced weekly or monthly, depending on conditions. water dishes in your milksnake habitat are great for maintaining levels of humidity, as well as giving your snake a place to bathe from time to time. to maintain the proper levels of humidity, you can either place a sponge in the water dish and rewet as necessary, or you can mist your snake’s cage once to twice per day. in either case, use your hygrometer as a guide and make sure that the enclosure is properly ventilated. branches and shelters milksnakes require hiding places where they can be by themselves from time to time (don’t we all?). without a place for them to hide they can become stressed out and develop health issues and even aggression. the good news is that it’s simple to provide a hiding place. it can be something as easy as a shoebox or plastic plant saucer with a hole cut out. all you need is four walls and a roof. just keep in mind that the hiding box will need to be cleaned just like the rest of the enclosure, so choose accordingly. /24, the natural habitat of the milksnake is full of nooks, crannies, trees and branches, thus branches should always be included in a milksnake’s artificial habitat. the only considerations are that you choose branches sturdy enough to support the weight of your milksnake, and that you soak any wild-collected branch in one part bleach-three parts water for an hour and then rinse well until you can’t smell the chlorine; let it dry overnight before placing it in your snake enclosure. this will kill any parasites and bacteria that may be living on the branch. heat and light milksnakes do well with a 25- to 50-watt incandescent bulb with conical reflector aimed at a nearby rock or branch for basking. however, since milksnakes are nocturnal, they don’t require the full-spectrum lighting that other reptiles like lizards and turtles do, though some herpetoculturists swear that full-spectrum lighting can add years to a milksnake’s lifespan. no matter what type of lighting you choose for your milksnake terrarium, make sure it is suspended outside of the cage, over the enclosure. light bulbs should never be placed inside a terrarium, even if it is shielded. the same is true for any heat source, whether hot rocks or heating pads. snakes tend to curl around light bulbs and other heat sources and will burn themselves if given the opportunity. humidity (air moisture) milksnakes require special considerations for their heat and humidity. ideal daytime temperatures in a milksnake enclosure are anywhere between 75 and 80 degrees fahrenheit, dropping a maximum of 4 degrees at night. as far as a heating apparatus goes, anything except hot rocks will work for milksnakes. just be sure to build your heating system so it provides a heating gradient within the enclosure. snakes like to regulate their own body temperatures, so having one end of the enclosure warmer than the other will provide them wiggle room to thermoregulate. as far as humidity requirements go, you’ll need to know where your particular species of milksnake originates. milksnakes from the southern end of the range will require more humidity than those from the more arid north. most milksnakes do well at 40 to 70 percent relative humidity. always be sure to have a thermometer and hygrometer set up in your milksnake enclosure to ensure appropriate air temperature and moisture.",Supplies for the Milksnake’s Environment,Milksnake _ PetMD,Reptiles,753,846

"mississippi map turtle diet mississippi maps are aquatic turtles; they do just about everything while swimming, including eating. in fact, mississippi maps will only feed when they’re in the water. they are omnivores, but adults tend to be more carnivorous than other “slider” turtles, to the point where it’s easy to accidentally feed them too much. when map turtles are fed too much protein it can result in an unhealthy growth rate and pyramiding of the shell. a proper map turtle’s diet begins with nutritionally balanced turtle pellets that you can find at the pet store. the turtle’s diet should be supplemented with fresh, leafy greens and healthy, low-fat proteins as well. mississippi maps enjoy dark leafy greens and vegetables like romaine lettuce, dandelion leaves, parsley, and spinach. as for the type of proteins you should give them, gender will be the guiding factor. since females tend to grow larger than males, they have larger jaws that can consume larger prey like snails and clams. males, on the other hand, have to be fed prey like aquatic insects, crustaceans, mealworms, mollusks and fish. while live fish can prove challenging for them to catch, mississippi maps have no problem eating pieces of dead fish. do not feed your mississippi map live mealworms as there is a small risk that the worms may harm your turtle. as a treat, and only as a treat, you can feed your turtle fresh chopped apple pieces. /24, when and where to feed mississippi maps young turtles will have bigger appetites and should be fed daily. adult mississippi maps can be fed between 4 and 5 times per week. since they eat in the water, place veggie leaves in the water and on the basking site, or clip them to the side of the enclosure with a rubber suction cup. some turtle keepers use separate feeding tanks to keep the water-quality in the main enclosure pristine, which can be a good idea depending on your available resources and space. offer only as much food as the turtle will consume in 4-5 minutes to avoid overfeeding and obesity.",Mississippi Map Turtle Diet,Mississippi Map Turtle - Graptemys pseudogeographica kohni,Reptiles,351,401

"painted turtle diet feeding your painted turtle painted turtles are good eaters and enjoy feeding on a variety of foods. adult turtles should only be fed once every two to three days or so; daily feeding will cause them to become overweight. painted turtles are omnivores, meaning they enjoy eating meat as well as plant matter. you’ll want to vary your turtle’s diet even if it prefers eating only one type of food. this is important for supplying your turtle with all of the vitamins and nutrients it needs to live a healthy and happy life. as far as vegetable matter goes, you can feed your painted turtle romaine or red-leaf lettuce (never iceberg), chopped mixed veggies, and collard greens. as for meat, you’ve got a few options: small feeder guppies, various insects and earthworms, pieces of chopped beef heart, cooked chicken pieces, and even low-fat dog food. the key to a good painted turtle diet is variety. supplements aside from plants and proteins, your painted turtle will require periodic supplementation with vitamins and calcium. this can be achieved by giving your turtle a calcium block to nibble on and by occasionally feeding it commercially bought turtle pellets. feeding tips a small tip when it comes to feeding your painted turtle: use a container! for just about everything other than placing live fish in the water, you should feed your turtle in a container that is separate from its living and swimming spaces. this will make it so that you don’t have to clean the habitat after every feeding. trust us, turtles are messy eaters. /24, ",Painted Turtle Diet,Painted Turtle - Chrysemys picta,Reptiles,266,303

"supplies for your painted turtle’s environment housing your painted turtle - habitat or aquarium setup whether or not you want to house your painted turtle outside or inside, there are a few basic characteristics every suitable turtle enclosure needs: adequate space, light and heat, and water. when it comes to the size of your painted turtle home, bigger is always better. /24, water painted turtles love to swim and need to have access to clean water, both for drinking and for swimming in. provide a water area that’s at least four times the size of the turtle, at a depth of at least 1.5 times the turtle’s length. a reasonable sized painted turtle tank would be 36 to 48 inches (91.4 to 121.9 cm) wide and at least 12 inches (30.5 cm) deep. this provides enough swimming room without posing an accidental drowning issue. if the water is too shallow, your turtle may injure itself when diving. if you’re keeping multiple turtles in one enclosure, increase the given dimensions by 25 percent for each additional turtle. a general rule of thumb is a minimum of 20 gallons of water for one painted turtle, and an additional 10 gallons for each additional turtle. remember, this is just a minimum, more is always better. this will give them plenty of space to move around. if you are keeping your painted turtle in an outdoor habitat, you might consider creating a real miniature pond inside your turtle enclosure. pond liners can be found in many pet supply stores and online, and you can decorate the pond with real or fake plants, stones, and even real fish—which also make for a wonderful fresh food supply for your turtle. make sure that are places around the pond where your turtle can easily climb in and out of it. also, locate the pond in a shaded spot to prevent the water getting too hot, and clean the water daily, either with a water vacuum or filter pump. light painted turtles take in a lot of sunlight in their natural settings. this is important because sunlight is a primary source for vitamin d3. that is, the uvb rays in direct sunlight cause the body to synthesize cholesterol in the body, creating vitamin d3, which has a direct impact on metabolism and calcium balance. if you are going to be keeping your painted turtle indoors for much of the time, you’ll want both incandescent and fluorescent lights. incandescent lights are used to light and heat certain parts of the tank and should be set up above the basking areas. take care to keep a thermometer at the basking site to prevent the area from overheating. fluorescent lighting provides the overall light level and should be provided for painted turtles. a source of ultraviolet (uv) light is strongly recommended for the overall health of painted turtles. use a uvb light to help supplement your pet turtles with vitamin d3, arranging the light in a way that the light is not blocked by a layer of glass, plexi-glass, or plastic, as uvb rays cannot pass through these materials and the beneficial wavelengths will be blocked from reaching the turtle’s body. /24, heat temperatures that are comfortable to the average human are way too cold for painted turtles. painted turtles, like other reptiles, are ectothermic, meaning they warm their bodies using external sources of heat. supplemental heat can be provided in the form of an undertank heater or submersible water heater. no matter which type of heater you choose, you’ll need to monitor the temperature inside the enclosure with digital thermometers to prevent the water from overheating. a best practice is to pair electronic thermometers with alarms that go off if the temperatures drop (or go to high), this way you can be sure proper temperatures are maintained. shelter and basking spots even though turtles come with their own built in shelter, they still need a physical place to hide away securely. you can create an underwater hiding spot using either real or fake plants, but take care that your turtle will not get trapped in the spot as there is a risk of drowning. the plants will need to be checked and replaced periodically as well. if your turtle’s habitat is outside, make sure that at least one area is open to the sun. painted turtles love the sun, so they need a spot that is totally out of the water, where they can haul themselves out to dry off and get warm. driftwood, corkboard, and smooth flat rocks all work well, just make sure you use something your turtle won’t scratch its shell on. if your turtle habitat is indoors, place a uvb spotlight over this area to enable your turtle to bask there. decorations aside from a spot to dry off, painted turtles don’t require any other sort of tank decoration, though some turtle keepers think a plain tank looks much too sterile. turtle safe plants will create a pleasing environment, but keep in mind that anything you place in the tank will need to be regularly cleaned or replaced. rocks and pebbles can also be used for effect, but size is a consideration. gravel that can be swallowed can cause digestive issues for your painted turtle, so choose a substrate that is too large to be taken into the mouth, or so small that it will pass through your turtle’s digestive system easily. if in doubt, seek advice from your local herpetoculture expert.",Supplies for Your Painted Turtle’s Environment,Painted Turtle - Chrysemys

"reticulated python diet as with any giant snake, you’ll need to secure a permanent food source before bringing your retic home. the feeding regimen you adopt will depend on whether you’re raising your snake to breed. the diet and feeding requirements for a reticulated python are the same as those of a comparable-sized burmese python. reticulated pythons are voracious eaters and usually prefer live prey over prekilled, frozen, or thawed. injury to the snake due to combative prey is a concern, however, so it is still advisable to avoid live feeding to prevent injury to your snake. /24, all pythons have special heat-sensing organs called pits that can detect the slightest changes in temperature, so if you’ve got a retic that’s reluctant to eat, warming the meal slightly beforehand can help. one safe method that works for warming prey is to take the baggie the prey is stored in and dip it into heated water for about an hour (boiling water can melt the plastic baggie, so take care with the water temperature). if you are taking the prey from frozen, place the baggie in warm water for a couple of hours, with a dish or coffee mug on top of it to keep it submerged. never warm prey in a microwave. the microwave will cook the meat rather than warm it, and your snake will either not eat it at all, or may be sickened by the meat. to prevent obesity, don’t power feed your retic for the first 3 or so years. as your snake gets older, cut back the feeding regimen as its growth naturally slows. how much to feed your python — age and size matter hatchling reticulated pythons should be fed just-weaned baby mice for their first few meals before moving on to larger adult-sized mice. after your retic has eaten a few meals’ worth of adult mice, you can comfortably move to this all-purpose reticulated python-feeding regimen: from hatchling to 4 feet (1.2 m): feed one or two appropriately sized mice every 3-4 days. at 4 feet (1.2 m) you can switch to medium rats before graduating to larger rats. from 4 feet (1.2 m) to sexual maturity (10 feet [3 m] in females, 8 feet [2.4 m] in males): feed one or two prey animals every 7 days. by 6 – 7 feet (1.8 – 2.1 m) switch to 3-pound (1.4-kg) rabbits, increasing the size of the rabbit as your snake grows. from sexual maturity (appx. 18 months) to three years old: feed one or two rabbits or equally sized prey animals once every week. from three years on: feed one to two rabbits or prey animals every ten to fourteen days, adjusting your schedule depending on the snake’s overall appearance. how to safely feed your reticulated python whenever dealing with a giant snake it’s recommended that another adult be present to help you and to keep a watchful eye. once your reticulated python is larger than 6 feet (1.8 m) in length, you’ll need to adopt several safe-feeding habits to prevent injury. 1. always have the prey animals within easy reach. 2. if you have multiple snakes, only feed one snake per enclosure at a time. 3. when removing uneaten prey, always use a snake hook, shield, wooden board, or other sturdy barrier as a buffer between you and the python. /24, safe feeding tips in addition to adopting safe feeding habits to protect yourself, there are a couple other cautions you should take to help protect your snake: 1. feeding your python prekilled is always the safest route to go since live prey can pose an injury risk, even to giant snakes. if you’re feeding rabbits to your reticulated python, you can ask your supplier to kill the rabbits when you purchase them. 2. large snakes love to eat fowl—it doesn’t matter what kind and it doesn’t matter if it’s dead and raw or live and whole. even though you’ll never hear complaints from your snake, it’s best to reserve chicken as a last resort. chicken is best used for fattening a retic that doesn’t want to eat, or for putting extra weight on as part of prebreeding conditioning.",Reticulated Python Diet,Reticulated Python - Python reticulatus,Reptiles,698,816
"reticulated python health owning a healthy reticulated python begins with the selection. it’s always recommended to observe the snake in its natural enclosure before you buy it, if possible, and to buy from an established snake breeder with a good reputation in the reptile community. the following is a short summary of reticulated python diseases and disorders. parasites as with any kind of snake, internal and external parasites can pose a problem. while internal parasites are rarely found in captive born and bred snakes, external parasites like mites can pose problems, particularly by transmitting diseases from infected snakes onto other snakes. luckily, snake mites do not live on other animals or humans—mites can, however, cling to the clothes and skin of people who have handled an infected snake and can be transmitted to uninfected snakes this way. always wash your hands and arms thoroughly after handling a snake, even your own, and change clothes in between handling snakes. respiratory infections respiratory diseases, particularly pneumonia, in snakes are common but can be prevented in most cases by ensuring the python’s habitat has proper heat gradients. a reticulated python suffering from early stages of pneumonia may wheeze when it breathes and tends to keep its head elevated. pythons suffering from more advanced stages of a respiratory disease will secrete a cheesy substance from their mouth and lower throat. if you see this foamy secretion you should contact your exotic species veterinarian as soon as possible. in many /24, cases, if the snake’s respiratory infection is caught soon enough, successful treatment can be as simple as fixing the heat gradient in its enclosure. some snakes may need antibiotic treatment from your vet. inclusion body disease (ibd) pythons are in the same family as boa constrictors, and boas are the primary host for an extremely serious and oftentimes-deadly disease called inclusion body disease (ibd). ibd is a retrovirus that attacks snakes in much the same way as aids infects humans (it is not transmitted from animals to humans). most retics that are exposed to the virus suffer painful, dramatic deaths, although others can be carriers for years without major symptoms. exposure happens when infected snakes share enclosures with non-infected snakes, during breeding, and if an infected snake has mites and the mites transfer infected body fluids onto other snakes. if you own multiple pet snakes of different species, it’s a good rule to never keep boa constrictors in the same cages as pythons. pushing there is one behavior that’s typical to reticulated pythons and which can lead to health problems if left unnoticed. retics are prone to “pushing” and roaming, behaviors that can signal an enclosure that’s too hot, humid, wet, or maybe that the snake is just feeling exposed. either way, too much pushing can cause your snake’s face to swell slightly or, worse case scenario, can cause permanent damage to its face, mouth, and head. it can even lead to mouth rot or an abscess. if this happens you’ll need to take a step back and evaluate why the snake is roaming and pushing.",Reticulated Python Health,Reticulated Python - Python reticulatus,Reptiles,512,580

"supplies for the reticulated python’s environment terrarium or enclosure setup the most important purchase you’ll make for your reticulated python is a proper enclosure. the enclosure you buy should be specifically designed to house giant snakes and must have a strong locking mechanism to prevent escape. hatchling and baby retics can live quite comfortably in a 10 or 20-gallon glass terrarium before moving to their permanent enclosure. the enclosure of an adult reticulated python should be one and a half times the length of the snake. for all but the largest retics an enclosure of 6 to 8 feet in length will suffice. reticulated pythons grow quickly initially, but after a few years their growth will taper off and then stop altogether. when it comes to your snake’s bedding—we call it substrate in the reptile world—you have options, but the important factor to consider is that it should be easy to clean and replace. substrates can be made from newspaper, aspen shavings, cypress mulch, corrugated cardboard, even specially made snake carpet. for decoration, aim for simple and easy to clean as well. branches and shelters remember, reticulated pythons are giant snakes and will destroy any fragile decorations or living plants you include in their enclosures. one thing that is important for a python is a secure hiding place, which can be made from large pieces of wood, hollowed out logs, or anything that gives the snake a bit of privacy from time to time. make sure that the hiding spot is large enough for the snake to fit its body within. retics that feel exposed and vulnerable will become stressed, will start roaming and pushing, and can easily contract diseases due to a stressed immune system or self injury. heat snakes are ectotherms, meaning they self-regulate their body temperature based on external sources of heat. for the temperature of your snake enclosure, you’ll need to provide gradients of heat so the snake can manage this. a proper python enclosure should have at least one hot spot that achieves a temperature between 88 – 92 degrees fahrenheit, with a daytime air temperature between 80 and 88 degrees fahrenheit. it’s crucial that you use multiple thermometers with digital readouts throughout the enclosure, one for the “hot spot,” one for the air, and one for the cooler section of the cage. a best practice is to pair electronic thermometers with alarms that go off if the temperatures drop (or go to high), this way you can be sure proper temperatures are maintained. /24, at nighttime, it’s ok to allow the temperature to drop down between 80 and 84 degrees fahrenheit, as long as there’s a basking area available for the snake to use. heat sources there are many different kinds of heating systems for snake enclosures, but for giant snakes the best option is to use pig blankets. here’s a quick overview of the different options for heating your reticulated python’s enclosure: pig blankets are giant heating pads enclosed in rigid plastic. they emit high surface heat over a broad area and are controlled by thermostats. pig blankets can only be special ordered through reptile specialty or feed stores. they are without a doubt the best commercially produced heating units for large reptiles. room heaters and space heaters are great if you have a large snake collection or an entire room dedicated to your snake. it’s important that you don’t place the heater too close to the cages, and take care not to let the enclosure overheat. heat pads and tapes are the easiest way to heat snake enclosures, just make sure you’ve got them connected to thermostats and temperature probes. ceramic heaters can be used as overhead heat sources but require the correct wattage bulb and sturdy ceramic bases that can handle the wattage. plastic sockets sometimes have cardboard liners that will begin to burn after just a few hours. as with any other heat source, always use thermostats or rheostats for regulation and cover the bulb with cage guard to prevent your snake from getting too close to the heat. hot rocks are popular heat sources, especially since they can be doubled as decorations, but should not be used with retics. snakes have the tendency to curl around hot rocks and can burn themselves. water a dish of clean drinking water should kept in your snake’s enclosure. retics do not require a dish that is large enough to soak their entire bodies in, but being that they love to swim, they may choose to if given the opportunity. mostly, you will want the dish to be heavy enough that it cannot be tipped over easily. check the water at least daily and refresh or change the dish out daily.",Supplies for the Reticulated Python’s Environment,Reticulated Python - Python reticulatus,Reptiles,788,876
"reticulated python habitat and history the reticulated python is native to thailand but can be found across asia. many of the first reticulated pythons to be imported to the u.s. were from thailand. /24, reticulated pythons live throughout the malaysian peninsula, southeast asia, and in the islands of the philippines and indonesia. they love to make their homes in rain forests, woodlands, and grasslands, and in the past were commonly found in even the busiest parts of bangkok. in fact, reticulated pythons were regularly known for eating birds, cats, dogs, chickens, sheep, pigs, and other domestic animals. there have been rare cases of pythons entering the huts of villagers and eating small children, but these are few and far between. retics are also excellent swimmers, which is how they ended up colonizing small islands in the philippines and indonesia. prior to 1990 it was almost unheard of to keep or even want reticulated pythons as pets because they were so large and mean. today, thanks to many generations of captive breeding, reticulated pythons are one of the most popular snakes around. this article was verified and edited for accuracy by dr. adam denish, vmd. /24, ",Reticulated Python Habitat and History,Reticulated Python - Python reticulatus,Reptiles,195,227
