        "text": "picking bird toys based on cage size and function one of the first things to decide is where your bird\u2019s new toy will go\u2014inside or outside the cage\u2014and in what section of the cage. make sure your bird\u2019s cage is large enough for the bird toys you want to introduce. bird toys that are going to stay outside the cage can obviously be larger and more elaborate than those inside the cage. for larger birds, there are many bird playstands, bird perches and toys for the top of bird cages. as a rule, i prefer moving a bird away from the cage and allowing him to play on a freestanding playground as opposed to being on top of their cage. whenever a bird is in their cage, they should be able to freely fly from end to end. flying is a natural bird behavior, and they should be allowed to fly anytime they wish to. this means that not only do large birds need really large bird cages, but small birds need pretty big bird cages, too. most birds are kept in cages that are much too small and do not allow them to actually fly. first evaluate whether you have an appropriately sized cage. even with a cage that has plenty of room to fly, you must also make sure that any toy that is placed inside the cage should be situated so as not to interfere with this activity. designate a \u201cflying area\u201d of the cage (usually the top half) and keep it free of all hanging bird toys. then reserve a corner or area in the bottom half of the cage for bird toys.",

        "text": "the soft and easy way to trim your bird\u2019s nails some of the best things about having a bird for a pet is holding it on your hand, letting it hang out on your shoulders, even on your head, and listening to it chirp and chatter in your ear. birds, like humans, have nails, and when their nails get too long the experience can be annoying, if not painful, when the bird digs its little nails into our skin. fortunately, this is relatively easy to remedy, but you will need to plan ahead and have all of the tools necessary for the task. prepare for success: because you will need to wrap your bird in a towel for grooming, part of the planning includes getting your bird accustomed to towels. using a light colored towel -- bright colored towels might alarm your bird -- lay the towel on your hand and allow the bird to climb onto the towel, maybe with some little treats and \"good bird\" affirmations to encourage your bird to be comfortable with the towel. do this on a regular basis so that when it is time to use the towel, your bird will associate it with good times. tools of the trade: for g-day (grooming day), gather all your grooming materials and ask a friend or family member to help (it is best if your bird is already familiar with the person). again, you don\u2019t want your bird to be overly alarmed by the process. if you should happen to cut a little too close to the quick when clipping the nail, use styptic powder, an antihemorrhagic that stops excessive bleeding. the other essential tool is the specially designed nail clipper for birds. the size of the clipper will depend on whether you a small or large bird. for a small bird, a pair of nail scissors may work out well enough, but for a big bird, a clipper that can cut through the thicker nail quickly and cleanly will be essential. take control: begin by draping the towel over your bird\u2019s back, leaving its head uncovered. as you wrap the towel around your bird\u2019s body and take the bird into your hands, be sure that you are holding it firmly at its sides, taking care not to press against its chest. this is important because birds do not have a diaphragm, so putting too much pressure on the chest may cause them to suffocate. even the most domesticated birds can get a little upset by being wrapped up, so you will need to take control of your bird\u2019s head to keep from being bitten. while holding the body with one hand, use your other hand to hold the bird\u2019s head. place your thumb on one side of the bird\u2019s head and your middle finger on the other, holding firmly enough to keep the bird from turning its head freely. maintain the bird's head still from the top with your index finger and reassure your bird with kind words to keep it calm. , clipping the nails: whether it is you, a friend, or family member that is trimming your bird's nails, the steps are the same. place one finger within reach of your bird\u2019s feet so that it can grasp onto the finger. use your thumb to lift each nail off of your finger, clipping just a small amount of the nail. you can always clip a little more from the nail, but if you miss the mark and clip too much the first time, you will have a very freaked out and bleeding bird to deal with, which is dangerous, as birds can bleed to death from this type of injury if it is not handled quickly. to avoid this scenario, first identify where the edge of the nail meets the quick (you can usually see this with light colored nails, as the nail is white and the quick is pink). if your bird\u2019s nails are dark, use extra care and trim just a little at a time. additionally, if your bird is handling the experience well, you may want to try smoothing out the edges of the nail with a nail file, but it is not necessary. what to watch out for: watch your bird closely as you are trimming its nails. you can expect your bird to be vocal about the indignity of the situation, often attempting to escape from your grasp. but if your bird appears to be having trouble breathing, is panting, is moving too much to keep a firm hold, or seems to have lost motor coordination -- like its eyes rolling back in its head -- stop immediately and place your bird back on its perch or in its cage and allow it to calm down, while speaking in a soothing tone. you can try to trim its nails again later, but if you encounter the same problems, have a skilled veterinarian or bird groomer do it for you. final tips: try to begin the nail trimming routine while your bird is young and use treats after the clipping so that your bird always associates this activity as a good thing. in between clips, place a sand or pumice stone perch (in addition to its natural wooden perch) in the cage. this will allow the bird to file its own nails and reduce the frequency of the nail clippings. in the wild, birds use both wood and stone to groom their own nails and beak, so having both for your bird will save you a lot of trouble in the long run. , ",

        "text": "human-food-only diet likewise, birds should not eat only human food. work with your veterinarian to determine the best diet for your pet bird. ideally, 80% of a pet bird\u2019s diet should be formulated or extruded pellets, such as zupreem\u00ae bird foods or harrison\u2019s bird foods. these diets are balanced to meet specific dietary vitamin and mineral requirements necessary for pet birds. while pellets should make up most of a pet bird\u2019s diet, they can enjoy having tasty human food as treats. sharing snacks with their human family is a great way to train and bond with a pet bird. however, birds are not small humans (even though sometimes they talk just like us.) some foods are highly toxic in birds, resulting in long-term costly illness and even death. your veterinarian can help you determine which foods are best for your bird based on weight, species, and overall health. the following foods are considered toxic in all bird species and should be avoided: avocado leaves, fruit, stems, bark, and seeds are highly toxic to birds\u2014 especially the leaves. the specific toxin in avocado is called persin and causes heart conditions, respiratory distress, and death in birds. small birds (like canaries and budgies) may be more susceptible; however, avocado toxicity also occurs in other bird species. birds may show distress within hours of ingestion and die within 24\u201348 hours. , chocolate contains theobromine and caffeine, which are methylxanthines that can cause heart rate and rhythm changes, hyperactivity, seizures, and death. in general, the darker the chocolate, the higher the amount of toxins. fruit pits and seeds , including apples, cherries, apricot, plums, and peaches, should not be fed to birds due to their level of cyanide. many birds enjoy eating fruit, but pet parents should carefully remove all seeds or pits to prevent cyanide poisoning. onion and garlic toxicity is well documented in many mammal species including dogs and cats. in birds, too, onions and garlic can cause issues with blood cells, liver, and kidneys. high-fat and high-salt foods like sunflower seeds are some of a pet bird\u2019s favorite foods. however, seeds are incredibly high in fat and equivalent to human fast food. prolonged exposure to high-fat and high-salt foods will have similar results in birds as in humans\u2014heart disease, obesity, diabetes, and liver disease. xylitol is an artificial sweetener that causes severe low blood sugar and liver disease in dogs. there is limited data on the toxicity in most bird species, but it is generally assumed unsafe for birds. other food items that may not be inherently toxic but can still cause issues with pet birds include: birds are susceptible to mold , so foods such as peanuts, corn, and other grains are discouraged. dairy products should also be given in small amounts, as birds cannot process large amounts of lactose. certain plants in the nightshade family (tomatoes, potatoes, eggplant, and peppers) may be safe for birds to consume, but pet parents should observe not to feed any part of the plant.",

        "text": "chickens have specific housing requirements chickens are appealing as pets to some people because many chicken coops are designed to look like decorative houses that are attractive additions to the yard. however, chickens have very particular housing needs, and some of these designer coops are not constructed to meet these needs. chickens need sunlight for example, not all chicken coops are heated, yet chickens housed outdoors in cold climates need heat when it\u2019s very cold so that they don\u2019t get frostbitten. similarly, chickens that are housed inside continuously over cold winters lack exposure to the sun\u2019s ultraviolet (uv) rays, which are critical to helping them make vitamin d in their skin. vitamin d enables chickens to absorb calcium from their food so that they can make hard-shelled eggs. without adequate uv light exposure, chickens often lay soft or shell-less eggs or have eggs get stuck inside of them when they try to lay\u2014a life- threatening condition called egg-binding. this happens because their uterine muscles run out of the calcium needed to push the eggs out. consequently, chickens living indoors in cold climates must have uv light bulbs built into their coops so that they don\u2019t lay abnormal eggs or become egg-bound. chickens need nesting boxes in addition, chickens will only lay eggs if they are provided with boxes in which they can nest. coops should have one box for every four to five chickens for optimal egg- laying. nest boxes ideally should be placed in the least-trafficked part of the coop to prevent disturbing hens while they are laying, and they should be elevated 1-3 feet off the floor to prevent predators from jumping in them and debris from the coop floor collecting in them. nest boxes should be lined with bedding (pine shavings or straw hay) to keep chickens comfortable and to protect eggs once they are laid, and the boxes should be cleaned out regularly. coops should be spot-cleaned daily and fully swept out weekly, and they should be placed outside in areas where the top layer of soil can be , raked up and removed at least once a year. this prevents chickens from ingesting parasite eggs that are passed into the soil in their droppings and re-ingested, thereby perpetuating the parasite infection cycle. chickens need a fenced-in area to roam in addition to a coop, chickens need a safe, fenced-in area outside to roam and exercise in when there\u2019s good weather. fences must extend both high above and deep below ground to prevent predators from jumping over and digging under them to get inside. chickens must also be provided with mental stimulation and environmental enrichment so that they don\u2019t feather-pick or bully each other. enrichment may be offered in the form of perches of different heights, tunnels made from cardboard boxes, compost piles to dig in, and hanging vegetables, like heads of cabbage or lettuce, that they can peck. other favorites for chickens include toys such as mirrors and rope swings, bins filled with sand to bathe in, and insects such as mealworms to snack on.",

        "text": "how to clip a bird's wings there are many different methods of wing clipping. however, not all of them work equally well to prevent flight, and not all of them last the same amount of time to prevent flight. the goal of a proper wing trim is to trim enough feathers to prevent a bird from achieving lift as it takes off, but not to trim so much so that the bird drops like a rock to the ground. a bird with a proper wing trim should be able to glide safely to the floor without sailing around. to hinder flight, you must trim the primary feathers. some people choose to trim a varying number of the outermost ten primary feathers, but only the outermost five primary feathers need to be trimmed to prevent flight, in most cases. trimming more than that, or trimming the secondary feathers, is not necessary and can actually cause problems when the sharp cut end of the trimmed feather is close to the body and sticks into the bird\u2019s side, causing skin irritation. many birds will pick at cut feathers if they are too close to their bodies, as the trimmed edges annoy them. cutting only the outermost five primary feathers makes it less likely that the cut ends will rub against the bird\u2019s body and disturb them. some bird owners leave the outermost two primary feathers intact when they are trimming, as this type of clip leaves a more pleasing cosmetic appearance when the bird\u2019s wings are folded, making it appear as if they are not clipped at all. i generally , why do birds need their wings clipped? do not recommend this type of clip, since all it takes is the regrowth of a single clipped primary feather in this case to allow the bird to fly again. many owners don\u2019t realize that a feather has grown back, exposing the bird to potential danger without their owner\u2019s knowledge. primary feathers should be cut below the level of the primary covert feathers (the shorter, smaller feathers visible overlying the primary feathers, close to their attachment to bone, on the inside of the extended wing). the lower third to half of the primary feather should be clipped off, but no more. trimming more than this length gets too close to the nerve endings of the feather at the base, near the bone, and may cause a bird discomfort. in addition, care must be taken never to cut a newly formed blood feather, as this could lead to severe, persistent bleeding that can be life threatening if it isn\u2019t stopped.",
