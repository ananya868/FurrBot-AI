        "text": "what do potbellied pigs eat? a pet pig diet is one of the most misunderstood parts of pig parenting, illescas says, and it\u2019s the most important aspect of owning a pig (or any pet) to understand. \u201cpigs grow so quickly that poor nutrition can cause lasting, or even fatal problems,\u201d he says. \u201cmany piglets are improperly weaned and then sent to new homes with strict (and harmful) feeding instructions, that many pig parents faithfully follow, unwittingly causing their pigs to suffer as a result.\u201d so how can a pet pig parent avoid these issues? by keeping their pet on a pelleted, balanced diet that is formulated especially for potbellied pigs as instructed by their accredited breeder or adoption facility, and of course, their veterinarian. according to illescas they should be fed this nutritionally complete diet twice a day, with a regimented schedule. additionally, you want to avoid high-sugar or high-processed foods for treats, says gray, adding that low-sugar, high-fiber fruits and veggies make the best treats for pet pigs. pig parents also have to find a balance between what they feed their pet and how much they eat while grazing outside. madison says that if a pig eats grass in your backyard, depending on its intake, you should lessen the required amount of food for that day based on how much it ingested. when it comes to keeping your pig hydrated, gray says that water consumption varies with the amount of exercise your pig has and how much water is in their food (lots of veggie treats often means less water intake). \u201cthe main thing to watch for is not the amount but the availability,\u201d he says. \u201cpigs like to root so will often splash their water out of their bowl and not have any to drink later. this needs to be monitored closely.\u201d",
